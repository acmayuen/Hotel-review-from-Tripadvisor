0,Date of stay: March 2023,50,Exceptional Service at The Peninsula - Thank you Irina,"Peninsula is a Hong Kong legacy for us locals. Each time I visit the hotel, it gives me a very special feeling. In fact, most important ingredient in the receipt is - the people. Irina is a perfect example and a role model.

It was a great night of gathering with an old friend. Upon my arrival at Felix, Irina greeted me with a big smile and she was very engaging. The restaurant has nice decor with beautiful view of Hong Kong. Food was good and nicely presented. Irina came by to check on our satisfaction and chatted with us from time to time. She was busy the whole time, very efficient (totally adapted to the Hong Kong spirit) , moving around rapidly without feeling stressed. We felt being looked after and it made the whole experience more remarkable.

Thank you Irina , Felix and Peninsula for one of the most unforgettable experience. I wish Irina every success in her career and I am looking forward to my return to Peninsula already……"
1,Date of stay: December 2022,50,"Exceptional service, comfortable stay","Stayed three nights in hk with family after 2 weeks holiday in Japan.

The peninsula isn't new but is of great make, rooms are confortable, the real stand out is the personalised concierge service the Peninsula provided, they made our stay hassle free especially when there were mandatory gov requirements to be met for inbound travellers.

""Kit"" from the concierge team made our stay memorable. We feel that Peninsula's service goes that little bit further than Aman tokyo and St Regis Osaka from our recent experience."
2,Date of stay: February 2023,40,Classy,Wonderful anniversary staycation with my wife and everything was nicely arranged for us. The room was clean and very luxurious and the views are nice. The breakfast is really yummy and we loved the dim sum section. The high tea a little too expensive but it’s good.
3,Date of stay: February 2023,50,Really good place. Good Hospitality,"Good place to stay in. Really good location near shopping places. There is a wide variety of restaurants downstairs, the place is really clean and beautiful. Staff is nice compared to all the other places in Hong Kong. Would highly recommend this place."
4,Date of stay: January 2023,30,Tea in the Lounge,Had looked forward to the famous afternoon tea in the Lobby Lounge and my son was kind enough to take me. Sadly I thought it very disappointing. The savoury plate was particularly bad. Nice toppings on thick bread and the pastry vol au vents very tough not light and crispy. Seemed they had been frozen. The scones were also heavy. I am afraid that the Mandarin wins by a long way.
5,Date of stay: January 2023,50,Daddy birthday celebration,"Excellent experience, from hotel check in (special thanks to Phoneix for his extraordinary service and attitude) to hotel room, facilities to the staff attitude

We did enjoy a lot. It’s amazing that the hotel greet us with a birthday card and cake 🎂 it’s so sweet 👍🏼

I would say, it is a must-try hotel in ur life! Proud of the penisular hk 🫶🏻"
6,Date of stay: October 2022,50,Best in class service!,Stayed with family. Great hospitality. You are made to feel special. Also there is a swimming pool which is good for morning exercise before breakfast. The location is also good for easy access to nearby shopping or for taking the various ferry terminal nearby.
7,Date of stay: December 2022,50,Lovey Christmas Family Staycation!,What an amazing Christmas family staycation and a huge thank you to Mr. Henry Ho Assistant Guest Relations Manager and the entire Peninsula team! It was our first time staying at the Peninsula and we chose it for our 13th year wedding anniversary and also for our Christmas day lunch. We had a lovely Harbor Front Deluxe Suite and our two sons were in comfortable roll out beds in the large lounge room. The suite was HUGE with luxury fittings and amazing views where we enjoyed the night lights show. The service from Mr Henry Ho and the entire Peninsula team was exceptional! We were fortunate to have our Christmas Day lunch inside the 'vintage train' and we loved the large Christmas tree in the lobby and the choir singing carols. We are expats that live in Hong Kong and have been fortunate to visit some top international hotels around the world and we found the Peninsula Hotel to be on par with the best of the best. Our boys loved meeting Santa and the amazing Christmas arts and crafts held at the Peninsula. All the food was exceptional. Our only (small) comment was the pool was a bit cold and not the reported 29 degrees. but none the less our boys had a swim while the parents had a nice drink at the pool bar watching them. We are already discussing our next stay. Thank you the Peninsula Hotel for your efforts. 10 out of 10.
8,Date of stay: May 2022,50,Stay with PEN,"I been stayed with peninsula twice in May 2022.

Really enjoy their hospitality and good food.
They have a splendid swimming pool and lobby lounge, which I had a very good time there in May.

Breakfast with lobby lounge is great, but I also look forward to try buffet breakfast in The Verandah for next stay, heard their buffet breakfast was good tho.

Wish to visit THE VERANDAH and FELIX next time."
9,Date of stay: December 2022,30,Not the Peninsula I know,"Low value for price paid, slow and indifferent service, no welcome, staff English skills very limited and they clearly are no longer focused on foreign guests rather the wealthy Chinese

As a hotelier at this level myself I’m immensely disappointed, is this the new Hong Kong"
10,Date of stay: November 2022,10,The worst pre-stay experience,"Our family was tested positive before the stay with The Peninsula Hong Kong. We wrote to their CS team to explain the situation and asked for a date change. We were then being told that 4 times of booked price will be applied for date change plus we must choose a new date to stay within Nov. (Which our original staying date is 19 Nov). What makes you think we can be fully recovered and schedule another stay within 10 days?

We are just asking for a humanised option but the manager was being so unthoughtful. We were granted a FREE cancellation at the end.

This worldwide pandemic has been affecting each of us over the past 2 years and I believe all of us don’t want to get involved it. I just don’t understand why your team cannot think at guests’ perspective.

Never ever have such an awful experience with 5-star hotels. Not in Hong Kong. Not in other countries."
11,Date of stay: September 2022,50,Excellent food and tea,"I went to the Chinese restaurant Tin Lung Heen. The food was excellent especially the pork belly! We tried some amazing tea thanks to the recommendation of Amanda.
I will come again very soon! Thanks for the service."
12,Date of stay: September 2022,20,"Service is good, but hygiene...","I informed hotel in advance that this stay is for birthday celebration and marriage proposal. The staff at front desk is very polite and kind, she introduced the room facilities and upgraded us to Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room. Thank you very much.

There are three meals are included under the package, we have lunch, dinner and breakfast at The Lobby, the dishes were well presented and tasted good. I would like to compliment one of the staff here, but I don't know her name. When we decided to exchange our dished, a female staff helped us immediately even she was far away from us.

Although the service is impeccable, the hygiene issues made us felt discomfort.

When I enjoyed soak, I looked up and found there are lots of black dots (should be mold) on the wall. Besides, when I woke up the next day, I felt itchy and there were small red spots on my feet.

The hygiene problem was daunting, and also made this marriage proposal a bit unpleasant, I hope hotel can pay more attention on this."
13,Date of stay: August 2022,50,"Interesting Peninsula HK ""JOURNEY THE WORLD: NEW ENCOUNTERS"" STAYCATION","Enjoyable and relaxing trip on 27-28 Aug. Package include $800 dining credit + two encounters. Excellent service as usual!

We were first greeted by Hazel, a cheerful lady, who also escorted to our suite. The first impression towards a hotel is always rely on he front line staff and Peninsula staff always give us excellent impression. Of course, we were surprised by the sweet ""treats' the customer service team offered. :)

It was the first time we book this encounters package and we both were delighted with the activities we chose. The first encounter we experienced was Louis Vuitton Scent Bag Making. It didn't take long to make such a nice souvenir but the process was really enjoyable. The second encounter we chose was Flight Simulator. Dennis, the ""co-pilot"" :), was so enthusiastic and professional. We were happy that we made the right choices! But of course, we will try some other encounters and taste more encounters next time!

We were tempted by some new hotels this year and we were in most cases, disappointed. Luckily, we chose Peninsula this time and definitely we will choose Peninsula again and again in the future!"
14,Date of stay: August 2022,40,Mix of Tradition and Modern Staycation,"Been here a few times for meals (high tea/dinner) but have never stayed here until my 1-night Staycation during this week.

The lobby decor feels historical and elegant (but not old) with a nice area for check-in. The rooms/bathrooms were extremely nice with high ceilings and the decor was classical but equipped with modern facilities (wireless charging, USB ports, Smart TV with free in-room entertainment, bedside tablets, printers, Nespresso Machine). There seems to be an issue with the connection of Airtime (in-room entertainment) as it sometimes lags/pauses. The 8/F swimming pool is a must-visit for its roman-inspired theme and night views of the Hong Kong skyline.

For dinner, we went to Spring Moon. The service and food were what you expect from a 1-star Michelin restaurant. However, the restaurant could consider introducing half portions as it was difficult to order a good variety for 2 people.

As part of the Staycation, Breakfast was at the Lobby Lounge with either a Western or Chinese set. The quality of the Western set was very good but was disappointed with the Chinese set, in particular, the Dim Sum which tasted like frozen quality (ones you get from supermarkets/convenience stores).

Suggestions - As the 6/F function room was the location for mooncake pickup, should the main doors to the rooms be closed (and only accessible by guests)? Given that the elevator access to other facilities was restricted, think it's more appropriate if the 6/F rooms were also restricted."
15,Date of stay: August 2022,40,unforgettable stay,"Enjoyed a pleasant staycation at the Peninsula, except for the dining experience at Gaddi's.
The Rolls Royce transfer was incredibly comfortable . The room was very comfortable and the Victoria Harbor view was superb. Thanks for preparing gluten free breakfast, tea set and lunch for me.
Especially the tea set was so impressed.
The most important was I didn't have any allergy reaction, which is very rare. Thanks you.
For Gaddi's, I was very disappointed with the service provided, which is not acceptable for a Michelin restaurant.

We will return to the Peninsula, but not Gaddi's."
16,Date of stay: August 2022,50,Five star journey,"I have always been a big fan of Peninsular. Everyone here is really nice and genuine. The staff at the entrance were friendly, they greeted us and showed us the direction. While we were at the lobby area, everyone were very welcoming. Love the music and the ambiance there.
Felix has one of the best view in Hong Kong. Food was exceptional. The execution and presentation was flawless as was the service. We were lucky to be seated by the window. Service was impeccable. I was very clumsy with my shopping bags and the hostess proactively assisted us with a smile. The bartender (Louis? was sweet and amiable, he was very patient and provided us helpful recommendations. The drinks were lovely. Woodie and Rana, thank you for taking care of us. It was my partner’s birthday, she was truly touched. It was such a memorable experience. We will definitely come back for you guys!"
17,Date of stay: August 2022,50,No.1 Hotel for Proposal Staycation,"It has been a wonderful stay in the Pen for my proposal Staycation, thanks to the hospitality of the hotel and it's wonderful staff. Booked a staycation package with a 4-course dinner and the Gaddi's and Peninsula generously upgraded my harborview room to harborview suite! I was allowed to early checkin to make all decoration and I was even gifted a romantic dessert after my successful proposal!

The dinner at Gaddis was great. The french gourmets were delicious and the live band was a big plus and the atmosphere was both elegant and relaxing.

Back to the room from dinner and found a special gift on the table - the infamous door guardians fragrance soap!

The lobby breakfast and the takeaway tea set were also great

All in all, it has been a 120 points stay at the Peninsula, thanks!"
18,Date of stay: August 2022,50,Farewell Staycation ❤️,"It’s late but I would like to thank to everyone who made our staycation so amazing as well memorable.
Firstly thanks to Hazel for arranging a farewell cake to the room. She was so polite and very calm while making our booking on a call then we had dinner at The Felix we enjoyed every bit of it. Excellent service by Sally and Cathy. As well the housing keeping team too whenever we ask for something it was so fast!
Lastly this foreign lady at the washroom she overheard our conversation and told us to ask housekeeping for sanitary napkin but surprisingly when we reach at room someone brought to us.
Impeccable serve by everyone can’t wait for another one ❤️"
19,Date of stay: August 2022,20,So-so eperience,"The experience was just so-so this time. Everything is just average, not up to Peninsula standard. Room, view, food, services, all were average. Hopefully all will be improved.
Not sure if we will come back again or not."
20,Date of stay: July 2022,50,The AE package with Peninsula,"A very traditional environment, where it has kept British tradition design. Especially the tap in bathroom and the music at The Lobby. My wife and I felt so good during this trip with kind service by Peninsula team. The benefit from AE we can enjoy the check-in time at early 0600 to check-out time at 2200, moreover a room upgraded and a little bit credit. Although that wasn't a seaview room but acceptable (The view of some satellites setting up on top the opposite building) .

What impressed us most is that the dinner at The Lobby last night. The staff's name: Daniel, gave us a premium service and acted in a professional manner. We cannot regonize the name plate in a very dimmed environment. The name got when took the pill at last. Not limited to him, but all of them.

Last but not least, please keep this good services on and see any surprise in our next visit."
21,Date of stay: July 2022,50,Wonderful staycation at peninsula Hong Kong,"We went for a staycation at the Peninsula Hong Kong from 25-28th July 2022.

We were two families with 4 members each, and we had the most amazing time at the Harbour View suite with stunning views, outstanding hospitality, the amazing pool, and sumptuous food.

A special shout-out to two ladies

First Lola Leung, Customer Service Agent who was easy to deal with and crafted the special deal for our stay

And secondly our host Hazel Tang (Guest Relationship Manager) who was extremely attentive to our needs and always helping us improve our stay. Thanks a lot hazel !

We will be back for sure

We will be back for sure"
22,Date of stay: July 2022,50,Birthday Staycation!,"July was special! Because, it was my birthday and I got to spend the day at the heart of Hong Kong in the most iconic and luxurious hotels in the world. The Peninsula, is everything you have heard of and read about or more. Opened almost a 100 years ago, it is still boasting the majestic, colonial past with an amalgamation of 21st century modernity. From the hotel concierge to the waiters of the restaurants, service was on point. They treat you the most special way one can imagine. The free SPA gift to a complimentary birthday cake they thought of it all. If you are stuck in hk for the past two years and want to get away to feel special for a day, The Peninsula can be on your list. It can be on the more expensive side but worth every penny!"
23,Date of stay: July 2022,30,A 5-star hotel doesn’t quite live up to expectations,"To begin with, there was neither a queue nor any guidance at the check in area. While we had been standing in front of a check in desk, other guests who came later could easily go before us and check in. What a mess.

We had breakfast and dinner at The Lobby. I can’t say there was any service at all. Waiters and Waitresses were always busy with something and paid minimal attention to guests. Average waiting time between courses was 30 minutes or more after we finished the previous course. Even guests who arrived later than us got their food before us.

The food quality could not justify the waiting time. Notable mention goes to the pate en croute. It was like frozen food taken straight out of the fridge. Pretty sure that it wouldn’t break into pieces if I threw it at the table. And the crust pastry was soaky. Other dishes were okay, not great not good. It was just okay.

Speaking of the positive, the room was well equipped, clean, and the furniture was in good shape."
24,Date of stay: July 2022,40,Very nice Swimming Pool & panorama harbour view is awesome!,"Last time due to the pandemic the pool was closed. This time its great that we can enjoy swimming in this Roman interior design + lion sculpture pool. Very grand and special. The panorama harbour view is awesome! Don’t want to leave….. > <
This time we booked a deluxe harbour view room. Room is spacious and the harbour View is great! For sure harbour view room or suite is highly recommended!

Staffs are very nice Service is super good as last time! Chinese breakfast set is delicious 😋 Will stay again ^ ^"
25,Date of stay: July 2022,30,Worst Forbes 5 Stars Hotel in Hong Kong,"- A room with totally no view. NO view at all, just the YMCA building directly in front.
- Waited 40 mins for check in. Unacceptable for a Forbes 5 stars hotel.
- No welcome card, even not a computer printed one. I would expect all forbes 5 stars hotel would offer hand-written welcome card.
- No welcoming cake or similar, just 3 red apples.
- The room is dark even with all lights on.
- No warning of the water depth of the swimming pool.
- No kid playroom. Not a kid friendly hotel."
26,Date of stay: August 2021,50,It’s the Pen! Top notch!,"We stayed here for 3 nights at the suite. We got an upgrade and the suite is huge!!

The view is excellent. Service is excellent. The hardware is excellent. The price is of course not so excellent but it’s worth the money.

There are plenty of good reviews and I don’t need to say more.

Everything is great BUT service of Gaddis should be improved. Firstly, we don’t really felt warmly welcome. The service was a bit cold. Secondly, we were there to celebrate a birthday. Yet, the dessert chef spelt “Hapy Birthday” on the dessert plate. It was a big silly surprise. We told the manager immediately and he thought it was funny. Honestly - I think it’s a shame for the Pen …."
27,Date of stay: October 2021,50,A true classic,"While we didn't enjoy Hong Kong as much as we had hoped, we did very much enjoy our time in the Peninsula Hong Kong. It was everything we had hoped it would be. The location is also in a great place with the setting of Hong Kong harbor so near. Of course the service is great and everything is first rate. We would stay again in we returned to Hong Kong."
28,Date of stay: May 2022,50,Unforgettable Stay,"I booked this hotel for the first time in order to celebrate “Happy Mother’s Day” for my parents.
As they said they haven’t been here and they were already 70 years old, they did have an unforgettable stay here.

Staff is very nice and helpful starting from the entrance of the shopping arcade to check-in. The room is spacious, tidy and clean. The control penal is stylish which is a tablet. The coffee machine is user friendly and the coffee tastes good. The design in the room is so comfortable although it is a ‘many decades’ hotel. The sofa and bed are very comfortable. Bathing is so relaxing and enjoying with a miniTV next to the bath tub.

Breakfast is included. The room service is at the top level including the setting of dinning table, table manner and the food quality. When we check out, a take away tea set was also provided which is also very delicious.

Overall, the staying is very satisfactory. 6 stars is given and it is highly recommended for visitors and travellers. It is a bit pricey but it worths."
29,Date of stay: June 2022,50,The Peninsula Hong Kong - Traditionally Elegant Heritage,"For birthday celebration, we had chosen The Peninsula Hong Kong for staycation while we had been perfectly taken care of during the stay.

From check in experience to entering the room, the front service colleagues had provided warm welcome with their lovely smile. They were all very helpful and detail oriented confirming our itinerary throughout the stay. Colleague for luggage assistance was really efficient too! The room was clean while the marble bathroom design was classy. The electrical panel controlling different devices which was very convenient as well. Thank you for the birthday amenities!

The spa treatment was highlight of the stay. We had reserved a 60 minutes Swedish message and thank you for upgrading us to the couple room with amazing view of Victoria harbour. The whole experience was very relaxing with great pressure control. This is one of the best spa experiences in Hong Kong for sure!

Besides, we had breakfast and afternoon tea set at The Lobby. Understood that the team were very busy during weekend but they were trying their best to be professional offering refill and photo service etc. The historic and elegant design of the lobby with live band was definitely a plus.

Last but not least, we would like to express our gratitude to Henry from Guest Relations, Nancy from Baggage team, Michael from Concierge and Jeff & Kelvin from Reservation. Your service were impressive and thank you for making our stay memorable!"
30,Date of stay: June 2022,50,Wonderful Afternoon tea,"I am lucky enough to have been a few times to the Peninsula for their iconic afternoon tea. This visit did not disappoint..... The selection of food was first class and utterly delicious!
One friend has to eat 'gluten free'. We phoned in advance to request this and she was given and exquisite set for herself (see photo).
We were looked after by Sarah Choi who was the most attentive, polite and helpful hostess. She made a wonderful experience that bit better. Thank you."
31,Date of stay: May 2022,50,Value the experience & unwind after Five,"This was a surprise booking for my parents for my dad’s retirement. I booked an overnight stay with flexible check out and spa treatment with dinner. My parents were very pleased with the service and very much enjoyed their stay at Peninsula.

They had Harbour view deluxe room with breakfast and I added unwind after five offer which includes spa treatment and set dinner. One week down and they are still talking about how everything was so perfect and couldn’t have been any better.

I really appreciated the complimentary cake which was a surprise for me too! Thank you

I would like to thank all the team involved for your help and making my parents stay special. I look forward to visit HK soon and be able to experience firsthand.

Bw,
Rosmee"
32,Date of stay: June 2022,50,"Oasis in the city - a unique historical, cultural and architectural experience","Before I spent my first stay in the Peninsula Hong Kong, I may wonder if it’s too classic for me. Now here I am proven completely wrong!

I would rather say I had a unique historical, cultural and architectural experience instead of having an overnight hotel stay. This legendary hotel is bringing back history and story!

I would highly recommend the Deluxe Courtyard Room located at the hotel's old wing. The guest room with contemporary design is nicely furbished and perfectly maintained. The room also equips with multiple interactive digital room controllers (tablets) which I could control lightings, curtains and room temperature at my fingertips. Last but not least, the bed is so comfy too.

The dining experiences in each of the F&B outlets were both enjoyable. I had a pleasant, quiet afternoon at the coffee corner in The Verandah with pastries and the signature tea selections. To wrap up my night, I spent a few moments at Felix - a modern / avant-garde style restaurant and bar with stunning skyline harbour view. The L.O.B.S.T.E.R cocktail (coconut infused Martini with a drop of lobster bisque) was so nice! The breakfast was served at The Lobby. Although the food may not be top-notch, the atmosphere at this iconic and elegant dining venue made everything wonderful. Apart from the above, there’s actually one hidden gem worth a visit - the poolside bar. I felt like having a vacation outside the town when I was enjoying some drinks under the sunlight and fresh air at Sun Terrace. It's definitely an Oasis of the City.

In overall, the classic vibe becomes energetic and lively when traditional meets modern.

We did see a lot professional, helpful and experienced staff during our stay. Our first staycation experience in the Peninsula Hong Kong won’t be that wonderful and perfect without the effort of every single staff members!

Please allow me (and also on behalf of my boyfriend) to express our sincere gratitude to Hazel from Guest Relations for taking good care of us. Although the hotel was so busy during the long weekend, we still had a hassle-free experience on room check-in/out, restaurant arrangement and swimming pool reservation with Hazel’s kind assistance. It was our pleasure to meet her and we were truly grateful to receive the surprising heart-warming amenities and handwritten card from her!

The recent staycation with such unique experiences was far exceeded expectation. I would look forward to my another stay, in the near future."
33,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Excellent Staycation,"Extremely impressed by our stay at The Peninsula.

The room was well-appointed with extensive tech features. Really appreciated the wireless chargers and printer. The beds and linen were comfortable.

The service was impeccable. From the ladies at front office (who proactively offered us an upgrade), to the helpful concierge and restaurant staff, everyone was always happy to assist you.

All in all, an excellent stay and I will definitely return without any hesitation."
34,Date of stay: May 2022,50,Nice staycation,"It was a forgettable staycation in a grand & historic hotel, their front desk staff demonstrated professional and hospitality manner that made me impressive especially a young lady staff “Tiffany”, though we have got a late check in arrangement, they tried their best to arrange us a connecting room and with a series of follow up n hospitality gift to us. We enjoyed a good stay with a nice harbour view deluxe room, very clean hygiene room and absolutely clean in every details. Room is spacious with separate cloakroom. Highly recommended hotel for staycation"
35,Date of stay: December 2021,40,Pretty Good,"To be honest, the experience was pretty magical, I didn't expect much as I walked in blindfolded but the scent told me all I needed to know! My only tip was that they didn't provide sleeping masks so I did have quite the supple eye upon my departure."
36,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Grand & Lovely Stay,"Beautiful stay with the family. Everyone's so nice; friendly and professional. From the bell attendants to the reception staff, very welcoming .The room were so big and once you're in, you get the 'homey feeling"" (connecting room in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View). Shout out to ""Chandra"" (is it correct) who's very patient and hardworking and to the whole team of Housekeeping department. Very efficient and friendly service. To all the staff of Peninsula Hotel, thank you so much for the warmth and unpretentious service. You really lived up to your name.
Hope to be back on our 19th Year Wedding Anniversary!!!!!"
37,Date of stay: April 2022,40,A relaxing stay,"A relaxing stay.
Attentive staff kindly fulfilled our late check-out request with no hassle. The room was quiet and had an excellent view of the Victoria Harbor.

Breakfast was fulfilling, their Earl grey tea is a must-try."
38,Date of stay: April 2022,50,Extraordinary experience,"I can't praise the Peninsula enough for a wonderful stay. My husband and I had always wanted to stay the Peninsula and decided to take advantage of a last minute staycation offer. We enjoyed a delicious set lunch in the lobby with a live jazz band playing some of our favorite songs, and then things got even better. We were offered the harbour room we had reserved or an upgrade to a harbourview suite since we were celebrating an anniversary. The only catch was that we would would have to wait an extra hour for the suite. We are so grateful to Andie for giving us the option!
The Red Phoenix suite was simply beautiful - enormous, with thoughtful design in all aspects . We especially appreciated the body jets in the shower, the corner bathtub with a view of Kowloon, the armchairs in the bedroom looking out over the harbour, and the chocolate mousse cake - an un expected surprise.
We enjoyed fresh pastries and a variety of items for breakfast in the lobby and brought home goodies for high tea. Everyone we interacted with was professional and friendly.
There is nothing I would have changed about our stay. We're already looking ahead to a return visit. Life in Hong Kong has been hard lately, but I left the Peninsula feeling refreshed and lighter somehow. It's a truly exceptional hotel."
39,Date of stay: April 2022,10,So called Michelin-Starred Chinese restaurant,"I will make this nice and short, April 1st lunch at Spring Moon “Best Cantonese Chinese restaurant in Hong Kong” as stated on hotel official website. In return surprisingly I found myself a long strand of hair in the soup based vegetable dish that was ordered.

After the dish was replaced and complimentary dessert offered there was no sign of follow up and investigation whatsoever. No one seem to care even during service or bother to ask how was everything if the food is to my liking.

Simply here is your bill. Thank you.

Perhaps my definition and standard of a michelin-starred restaurant differs to Peninsula."
40,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Hong Kong Icon...wonderful,"Wonderful birthday stay at the Peninsula with family. Service was perfect from arrival to departure, room was sumptuous, birthday cake and champagne a pefect start to our short break and in room dining was excellent (as evening dining not possible due to the pandemic). Well worth a visit just for the views."
41,Date of stay: January 2022,50,Perfect Anniversary Stay 2022,"The peninsula hotel is really luxury and fantastic. I and my wife love the lobby area very much. Enjoy breakfast in the lobby area is a must event for every stay.
This hotel is excellent for morning jogger. If you love jogging. There is wonderful harbour view jogging path in front of hotel. My room is Harbour View Suite. The Harbour view is wonderful. It is one of best hotel stay in world. There is my wedding anniversary staycation. It make me and my wife with unforgettable memory. I shall revisit this luxury hotel again. Thank you for special arrangement. A fantastic staycation."
42,Date of stay: March 2022,50,Wonderful Staycation Experience!,"It’s a great deal for such impeccable service!

Staffs are nice and friendly all along. Thanks Selah from Peninsula for touring us our room in details and trying her best to perfect our time spent there:)
Room is clean and spacious with amenities that are better than expected. The food is fine, especially the tea set to take away!

Definitely the best hotel Ive ever stayed in:)"
43,Date of stay: May 2021,50,Perfect 30th Birthday Stay,"I stayed here as a surprise from my partner for my birthday, and what a stay it was! The room had a fantastic view of Victoria Harbour and it was wonderfully cosy. The swimming pool and decking outside is a great highlight, we sat for two hours drinking the freeflow gin (which if I remember correctly was just a little over 100 dollars - fantastic value for money) and we enjoyed lazing by the pool. The hotel supplied me with a lovely cake for my birthday - complimentary, of course!

Being a James Bond fan, I was enticed by the green Rolls Royces parked outside and the general setting of the hotel that featured in The Man With The Golden Gun.

Dinner and drinks at the Felix was a great way to end the evening. We will definitely return - perhaps we will wait for post 6pm dining and general swimming pool restrictions to end before returning!"
44,Date of stay: February 2022,50,Opolent Luxury,"From the moment The Peninsular Rolls Royce limousine arrived, and at every moment thereafter The Peninsular Hotel and staff served to a standard of opulent luxury. The rooms are immaculate and the famous Peninsular High Tea was a highlight.
Due COVID restrictions F&B outlets were closed after 6pm, the Bar was also closed. Room service is still 24hours. Vaccination certificate was required for restaurants as expected.
The Oceanview Suite was massive, large TV’s in either room and the large marble bathroom. Modernized with integrated TV/audio & USB charging, BYO cords.
The hotel wasn’t busy so the extra service was appreciated. Room Prices were discounted, similar to other hotels. Our package had a $1000 F&B spend which covered dinner for 2.
Looking forward to going back again."
45,Date of stay: February 2022,50,Wonderful stay,"I was staying in a suite room 0503 feb 4-5, and my friends were staying in 0501 and 0532 as I remember. The service was just so good. My stay was an excellent break from the terrible days lately. The foods were fantastic too. All staffs were very attentive professional & helpful. The hotel and people all make it so special. The price I paid was absolutely worth it. We all enjoy much.

Special thanks to Amanda Law!! Thanks for all the arrangement to ensure our perfect staying experience. She is a guarantee that you will enjoy every second of the amazing hotel."

47,Date of stay: December 2021,50,A MAGICAL CHRISTMAS!,"I stayed with my husband on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day night and we had the most magical stay.

Hotel: both the exterior and interior Christmas decorations were spectacular. So thought out, so detailed and nothing left out. Every part of the hotel was decorated in a different way and made for stunning photos. The Lobby had music, choirs and band music throughout our stay, this made for an amazing atmosphere and made it feel so christmassy and special. The only downside is that The Lobby has nowhere to sit unless you are in the restaurant.

Room: on arrival we had an upgrade to a better room and the room was spectacular. The room itself was so spacious with a dressing area and huge bathroom. The amenities and special little touches in the room really elevate it.

Food: we had the set breakfast each morning in The Lobby and we had Christmas Day Buffet at lunchtime in the Salisbury Room. The breakfast was just the right size and had a little bit of everything - cereal, fruit, pastries, hot options and drinks. We took leftovers away with us and ate them later. The Christmas Day Buffet was outstanding, there was seafood (lobster, prawns, caviar etc) as well as traditional western Christmas Day options. The desserts on offer were so decadent and tasty. The food was excellent throughout.

Extras: as part of our stay we had three encounters included and we chose the Flight Simulator, Louis Vuitton Leather Workshop and Mahjong Engraving. They were private experiences with experts and were so much fun. They also really set The Peninsula apart from other hotels. We also had a Staub pan as a gift which retails at £300 on check out. The turn down service on Christmas Eve let us velvet stockings with biscuits and chocolates inside - this was such a special touch.

Staff: the staff were all exceptional. From the moment we approached the hotel entrance door, there were people on hand to help us. Every member of staff was helpful, professional and friendly. They were there whenever we needed something and even when we didn't. The staff were also amazing at taking photos - we have photos to cherish forever.

I would urge anyone who can to visit The Peninsula, especially at Christmas time. It was such a magical trip and I would love to return!"
48,Date of stay: November 2021,50,Superlative - we returned for our second stay,"We are long term Hong Kong residents and in November 2021 we decided to fulfil our promise to return to the Peninsula to celebrate a milestone birthday, but this time rather than stay one night we chose two nights in a harbour view suite. As anyone who has visited the hotel’s lobby will attest, it is gasp worthy, but none the less tasteful. Likewise the rooms are tasteful, but quietly understated where all the things you would ever need are thoughtfully provided just where you would expect to find them. However, there is something that has been provided that in most hotels, even those with a stunning view, is sadly omitted - a pair of comfortable armchairs with footstools where you can relax while appreciating the view. Much to our surprise we spent most of our waking hours in these two chairs appreciating the familiar, but ever-changing vista of Hong Kong Harbour. What bliss! There were several other outstanding features during our stay - the kind assistance we received from staff - Henry and Hazel in administration and Fan at Gaddis are just three of the many we would like to mention and behind the scenes staff must not be forgotten. Our son in Melbourne had wanted to send flowers to our hotel room as a surprise, but we had forgotten to tell him which hotel. When he learned he called the Peninsula at 8pm requesting roses and chocolates and these - a stunning large bouquet of red roses and box of fine chocolates were delivered shortly after - where else would this happen at that hour on a Saturday evening, especially in times of Covid? Regarding the cost of what might seem an extravagant weekend, we have spent far more on brief holidays in the region which have not been nearly as satisfying and also of course involved the frustration of travel. Would we do it again? Absolutely - we hope to make this an annual event. Thank you again Peninsula Hong Kong! Hong Kong is a wonderful town, blessed with such a grand hotel."
49,Date of stay: March 2021,40,Awesome Design Good Service Must Encore 😃,"All staffs we met were very polite, participated to greeting and helpful.

Victoria England interior design is awesome! Roma design of swimming pool is grand and special.

Room is spacious, comfortable, amenities and “iPad” style of control panel is modern and very user friendly."
50,Date of stay: November 2021,50,Par Luxury,"Love every thing about this hotel, a true emerald amongst all other hotels in Hong Kong, right from the minute you step foot into the door until you leave, everything is an experience here. The decor, the smell, the fine details including service from the staff is impeccable. Love the High Tea and Felix for drinks, always makes us come back for more. Well done TEAM Pen.... keep up your good work"
51,Date of stay: November 2021,50,The Best Service In Hong Kong,"Every colleague, our family met at Peninsula was EXTREMELY helpful, quite courteous, kind, friendly, show their best service to us, and willing to help my family from their heart that My wife and I can feel it. Including the staff in a swimming pool, gym room, room service, spring moon restaurant, front desk, Lobby bell boy, security, and the 1/F public male toilet cleaner still show his polite service to me.
Let our family say Thank you so much to all of you, and Especially Thank you to Jessica cheung who call me to show her help to us and follow our requests and (hazel Tang Guest Relations Executive show her respect and Professional service to us, without Her warmest help our stay wouldn’t be perfect.) And Ernest Tse who is duty manager to help out my room problem with one engineer.
Once again, show our appreciation to all your staff that help my family. We had a wonderful time and an unforgettable stay. We will never forget staying in Peninsula Hong Kong. It was Brilliant."
52,Date of stay: October 2021,50,Excellence Exceeded,"After a late decision to change hotels due to lack of service provided. We opted for the Peninsula Hong Kong to spend our wedding weekend.
What a fantastic choice it turned out to be.

Excellence from the moment we checked in.
We booked a room and after walking it we deemed it not suitable for such a special occasion. We promptly visited the front desk and asked if we could upgrade our room.

At this point I was just ‘Wowed’, after waiting a couple of minutes we were offered a complimentary upgrade to a suite. The hotel acknowledged the special occasion. This is where the previous hotel fell incredibly short.

Weddings are stressful in general however the team at the peninsula allowed us to decompress abs enjoy our new status as newly weds.

Attention to detail, and the overall ambiance was perfect.

I can not thank the staff enough!
Especially the team at the pool.

The Peninsula Hong Kong an icon and it certainly lives up to its reputation. I am so happy it has formed part of a memorable weekend."
53,Date of stay: October 2021,20,A disappointing stay,"I booked staycation through the peninsula’s official website to celebrate my hubby’s birthday. This was our first stay in the peninsula and we both had high expectations for the stay.

Unexpectedly, there was no birthday surprise at all and even the checkin staff would not say Happy Birthday to you. To compare, the ticketing staff in the Ocean Park are doing much better in the sense that they would say Happy Birthday to guests who are visiting their park on birthday.

Another thing I did not feel good about was the request I made to the Lobby’s staff to write “Happy Birthday” on my hubby’s dessert serving plate. I expected it would be handwritten. However, what came eventually was simply a piece of chocolate badge with “happy birthday” printed on it. I quickly thought of the chained cake shops like Maxims or Aroma Bakery…

Not to mention the so-so food in the Lobby (especially the salty stir fried noodles at breakfast), the overall experience in the Peninsula was not a pleasant one. It was robotic and full of disappointment. It did not worth staying on birthday. We are pretty sure that we will not come back again in near future."
54,Date of stay: October 2021,50,Relaxing and unparalleled staycation,"Peninsula offered a stay-in-style staycation package with deluxe room, breakfast and 1000 catering credit and 300 spa coupon. And it is in absolutely great value. The hotel itself is a classic building through of history and story. And the services were attentive and mindful. The room inside was upgraded to cater for modern needs such as wireless charger.
Swimming pool view is stunning with backdrop of Victoria harbour skyline. It is indoor with warm water which able to accommodate weather conditions well. In addition, due to COVID, crowd control measures in place to ensure all clients able to enjoy pool. I was fortunate to get 2 sessions as it was not at full capacity. We tried the Lobby afternoon tea, Verandah Breakfast set, Chesa lunch. And tried the best ever french toast in town at Verandah.
It is a trend to hv staycation in town. And I tried a couple of it. And not doubt it is one of the best. Strongly recommended."
55,Date of stay: September 2021,40,Good Reputation comes with a reason!,"Thinking to stay at The Pen for a long while, and finally chose to do it on my BD month. My family got 2 rooms booked and we were lucky enough to stay at a higher floor (25/F), one of our rooms was allocated right in the middle of the hotel facing the harbour view, very nice. The staff has sent us a big Tiramisu cake as a welcome cake, just right for us as a tea treat, thank you so much!

The hospitality that we had experienced from check-in, room tour & brief intro (not a big room but still in details) and the dining services were very professional and smooth. 

We booked 2 time slots (one per day) for using the swimming pool. The indoor one is indeed aged but guess there's nothing much that the Pen can do with a historical building. They are trying to provide the best services around the hotel.

My family and I had a dinner at the Verandah, very nice table with limited food selection (compared to other buffet) but good quality ingredients. I thought they do have macaron on the dessert station but too bad couldn't find any. The next morning, we enjoyed a relaxed breakfast at the Lobby where I like the quiet time in the morning more. If possible, go there for breakfast, the staff did suggest us to go other outlet for breakfast but good that I didn't change my mind.

We then had a delicious Chinese cuisine for lunch at the Spring Moon, the F&B staff were very attentive to details. We felt it was a great arrangement trying all three F&B outlets during our short day. Be well prepared, book your table(s) with the room reservation centre who helped with my bookings, made my stay easier.

I can't find reviews abt the Pen lately, guess people kind of 'forget' this special old hotel. So I would like to share mine and hope other locals get to know this more. If you are looking for a place to go, here you go. You will get to experience the good service from a brand with legendary reputation. Give them and yourself a chance!"
56,Date of stay: September 2021,10,Terrible lobby staff,"Incredibly disappointing and amateurish service and check in process. Queue forms immediately at check in, horrendous attitude by staff taking down information at check in. Alex at check in arrogantly tells us to go explore the hotel, leaves multiple guests including us infuriated.

Would give lower than a 1/5 if possible. If this supposed grand dame of hotels can’t even get its check in process running efficiently, it challenges the imagination on what it actually can do well."
57,Date of stay: November 2020,50,The landmark in Hong Kong,"One of the great historical building in Hong Kong since 1928. The lobby is breathtaking, staff always carry a smile and helpful. Room is in great design and historical, with some modern element. We ordered the room dining. The food was high quality and delicious, but not as good as I had in Four Season. Hope I can come back next time to celebrate my anniversary."
58,Date of stay: September 2021,40,The best Hotel ever,"What a lovely stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong.
We would like to thank you Chole and the little girl, the front desk staffs, they are so patient and nice to introduce the facilities in the Hotel and upgraded our room with the fountain view. We love the afternoon sunshine came into the room.

We had a dining coupon, we ordered in-room dining as we were carrying a little baby so restaurants are definitely not our choice. We are appreciated the incredible friendly staff , Joe, from Room Services department, he is so good and helpful, I can feel his smiling face behind the mask. Describe the food what we ordered. What an amazing staff so far I met in Peninsula.

Especially when I recalled the breakfast we had at the Lobby as the package requested, and checked with other staff that NO in-room dining can be arranged. the Lobby staff, Gigi, who was so impolite, no smiling, rush on everything and left few words about someone will carry a baby seat for you and then sharp away. This is a problem lack of man power during peak hours.

The swimming pool is small and few steps to walk down. My friend, a “pig”, slipped, got a injured on his palm, but no staff came and checked out any hurt of him. It was quite surprised me.

Oh yeah, the check out time took so long too, only two counters to handle the check in/out issues. That’s why I finally had to do the express check-out.

But overall, we do love the history at Peninsula and it is still a memorable moment.

59,Date of stay: September 2021,30,Peninsula HK appears to have abandoned TripAdvisor,"Peninsula Hong Kong WAS renowned for being one of Hong Kong's most luxurious hotels and for providing outstanding personalized service. Like many other visitors, I believe Peninsula Hong Kong is no longer capable of upholding its century-old reputation.

From the check-in procedure onwards, everything is subpar. A short check-in line is understandable to me. The wait would not be a huge issue. The behavior of certain employees, on the other hand, made me feel uncomfortable. Two staffs were talking loudly in the lobby over the current affairs, which I believe to be particular sensitive these days. I also overheard a staff member described a lady as an elderly woman (呀婆), which indeed surprised me.

Although polite, the staff that served me in checking in seemed chilly and without a smile. I was informed my room was not ready. I would like to know whether or not a room number had been assigned and she replied that none had been assigned. As I paid my bill in advance during check-in, I was given a receipt, and there was a room number shown on the receipt. That was same as the one I got later that day. I'm still puzzled as to why they have to lie for such basic information.

The room was pretty big, and the living room had a really modern design. The dated bathroom, on the other hand, was a stark contrast to the living room. There was no welcome card or welcome message, and the welcome amenity was three pears. In a legendary five-star hotel, welcoming a guest could surely be done much better.

After checking with the operator, I was once again upset to learn that comb, shaving kit, and bath salt, which would seem typical at a luxury hotel, were not provided in the room and were only available upon request.

I had afternoon tea at The Lobby and dinner at Spring Moon. The afternoon tea was lovely, but the service was average. The service and meal quality of Spring Moon were both deplorable. I have submitted another review on Spring Moon's page.

The swimming pool was one of Peninsula Hong Kong's most recognizable features. Each guest room may book a one-hour time slot, and no pre-check-in reservations are permitted, which is inflexible in my opinion.

Breakfast was only available in the form of a set meal. Guests might select either a western or an eastern style. Because of the huge number of visitors, it is served in The Lobby, Verandah, or Gaddis.

I'm not sure whether I'll return, but I'm not looking forward to it nor recommending it to others."
60,Date of stay: August 2021,50,Stunning,"Visited this hotel 5 times and always a quality met my expectations
Rooms are great and so the service, a great stay, pity was a short one
Will return and will stay longer also to test again the SPA overlooking the harbour while relaxing with great massage"
61,Date of stay: August 2021,40,Iconic Peninsula,"The ""Green Spot"" advertisement is one of the iconic memory of Hong Kong people of my generation for walking along the corridor of this iconic hotel. Decided to celebrate our 30th wedding anniversary at the Peninsula HK and thus a room with a view was booked. Knowing that seats are tight at the restaurants, I immediately PenChat with Hazel, Priscilla and Josephine @Operation to make my reservation for @Spring Moon, @Felix and @Gaddi's. Ladies @Operation are very helpful to secure my bookings for the restaurants and finally our itinerary of lunch @Spring Moon, dinner @Felix and lunch @Gaddi's were fixed. I strongly recommended guests of the Peninsula make use of PenChat earlier so that you can enjoy the restaurants of your choice.

The day b4, Marble contacted me via phone (she said she was not able to communicate via PenChat, strange ar) and arranged my check-in @Concierge to facilitate a smooth check-in for me and my wife. Marble also aided to reserve the slot of the @Swimming Pool sessions for our stay in day 1 and day 2. We went to @Spring Moon to enjoy our dim sum lunch after registration. Though it was a bit disappointed that our room with a view was not yet ready after we finished our lunch, ladies @Front Desk immediately offered to arrange a room for us to rest (and for me to work with my Notebook) and then led us to the @Business Centre to settle down while waiting for the room. It was not until 3:30 pm then our room card were handed over to us @Business Centre for us to enter our room.

We enjoyed an afternoon swim @Swimming Pool after unloading our baggage in our room. If a chair or a stool can be available in front of the dressing table inside the male changing room, the make up after swim would be a lot easier compare to a standing one. Moreover, Peninsula HK is suggested to replace the swim suit dryer which is literally not functional (the colleague inside the changing room can make it move using special skill where I cannot) in the male changing room. Apart from these glitches, facilities inside the changing room, such as locker, shower cabinet, towels, hair dryer, lotions, etc., were fine.

@Felix gave us a special welcome with a mood changing elevator ride (one can try going up and going down again and again cos it's free afterall). Food is good @Felix and the surprise of the chilly oil caviar definitely marked its place in my mouth. There is also a must visit spot @Felix - its washroom! Though not able to find us at our room, our anniversary treat from Kevin TSANG finally find us @Felix and we would definitely put Devotion, Love, Passion, Adoration, Promise in our live Forever.

After a morning swim @Swimming Pool, we ate our breakfast at the iconic @The Lobby. With a short break, we continue our lunch @Gaddi's. Special thanks to Jovy and Cedric @Gaddi's in giving us an unique Gaddi's experience. We then hv to bid farewell to our spectacular hotel room with a view, took a stroll in the arcade, make a close encounter with the live music b4 we left."
62,Date of stay: July 2021,40,Weekend Staycation,"Had an amazing time staying at the Peninsula, the thing we appreciate most is no matter how busy they are, there is always time for small gestures and the same top notch level of service that is synonymous with the brand.

The one point which may have sullied the experience slightly was just having too many children on the premises. Seems like even though the children are too hyper, loud and tend to bother other guests, the hotel doesn't ask the parents to tend to their children and calm them down"
63,Date of stay: August 2021,50,Justifiably famous.,"While we have been lucky enough to stay in several other absolutely wonderful hotels in HK, some just as luxurious as The Peninsula, I would say that staying here felt more special than any of those other 5* places. As expected, the room and service were exceptional, eating breakfast and afternoon tea in The Lobby was an absolute treat and their pool is spectacular too. And The Verandah is probably the best quality buffet I have ever had! But many hotels offers comparable or even superior features in many of these areas (the pool at the Grand Hyatt, the view at the Ritz-Carlton, the design of the St. Regis, breakfast at The Conrad) so I’m not sure whether it is the history and name that elevates staying here to an even higher level, but something does! And it may be that even with all the grandeur, two features of the room really stood out: the enormous bathtub and the integrated room controls (which actually worked and added to our stay rather than impeded what we wanted to do). But picking out individual aspects is incredibly hard as we loved everything about the stay. Furthermore, even though staying here is still very expensive, prices are MUCH lower than they would typically be, given the lack of tourist trade so booking might be an option for more people than would otherwise consider it."
64,Date of stay: August 2021,10,Very disappointing services,"I Have booked through the official website and have written the request upon booking. However, I can't see the guest request in the confirmation email. So, then I have sent an email again to reservation team but no reply at all. I have also tried to call to the front desk/reservation, have been waiting for over an hour for 3 times but still no one pick up. I am wondering if that is the service of such a 6 stars hotel. I am really disappointed about the services."
65,Date of stay: August 2021,50,半島的極緻豪華體驗,"今日04Aug來入住半島酒店!雖然佢既服務好就毋庸置疑有口皆碑，今日同屋企人第一次入住，終於可以切身感受到Peninsular Grand Deluxe Service係咩一回事！
我地明白暑假期間，廿四孝父母遍地開花，未必能夠喺三點前攞到房，所以我地先去到front desk 搞check in手續再擺低行李。一如期望，check in過程非常專業同smooth,我哋之前提出既preferences 佢哋都一清二楚，完全唔駛我地重複！
既然來到半島，梗係先到lobby 歎番個afternoon tea,「半島high tea,酒店美斯」來到又點可以唔朝聖呢？依家Tea set $748 兩位，每位最低消費$350！我地book staycation package,有酒店dining credit,所以叫左兩個tea sets 來食！
半島伯爵茶、傳統鬆餅、鴨肝慕絲…..真係令人一再回味，而且今日lobby客人唔多(唔多既定義係條龍未兜過去Felix🤣🤣)我地可以享受一個寧靜既下午茶。
High tea未完，房間已經準備好，*半島服務來啦*，front desk 有人攞房卡俾我地，呢啲就係服務！
我地攞完房，梗係落去泳池玩番陣(大家記得book左先，疫情關係每次限一小時),小朋友喺泳池暢泳，我同太太就到泳池露天平台影相打卡！半島泳池真係精雕細琢，每個細節都盡顯心思，雲石牆、獅子頭噴頭、每邊都有員工留心泳客以防萬一(泳池應該唔俾影相，無謂令人難做，就唔影了)!游水時間到左，職員會逐個客人細聲提點😊不保證使你開心，但一定唔會令你激心！
游完水，上番房冇耐，room attendant就送咗welcome tea & fruit, 仲送埋個生日蛋糕上來。嘩！大佬，你擺明計住我泳池booking時間喎，細心到咁，點唔俾like呀！五點幾時，仲有Hskp問我地駛唔駛開床服務，幫我地整理好床單，令我地可以施施然咁就寢👍🏻
講番房間，房型係海景套房，一家人真係夠晒地方走動！景觀係對正維港海，絕對冇得輸，內櫳既廳有L型梳化，*細心位又來*梳化扶手沿位有個可拉式杯墊，對鍾意飲咖啡既我，實在一大方便，而特大LED電視既頻道選擇亦非常多，唔夠？仲有DVD movies 選擇！嗰個complementary amenities 真係夠晒一家飲用。備有唔同味道既coffee和tea bags!
另外仲有一衣帽間，掛衫擺行李雜物基本上係鬆動有餘！再入去就係bathroom, 全雲石設計，豪華而俗套，浴缸🛁and花灑係基本，裝埋電視喺浴缸前面，浸浴睇奧運兩不忘🤭
睡房擺完張king size bed仲可以放張extra bed,空間感依然十足，而現代人最緊要既手機充電位多到你唔信，USB頭、無線充電器、插蘇位….基本上周圍都有得幫手機充電🔋而房內既iPad 已可以控制整間房既電視、燈光亮度、窗簾、冷氣……
而房內既檯，為左盡量地俾到大面積客人使用，檯頭既鏡係使用收納式，按一個制就可以升起及隱藏，對於又多手袋又想用鏡既女士真係一個好設計！總結整個房間，俾足滿分！
另外要提大家一樣野，半島酒店為保障住客安全，規定凡午夜12點後，客人出入都要到front desk核實身份，證明係酒店住客，如果冇登記，就唔俾入架啦！
Ps: 每次行過front desk counter,職員明明對住電腦做緊野都會擡起頭同我哋打招呼，真心懷疑佢地頭頂有對眼👀
Special thanks to Front Desk Marble 😊

半生時間睡夢中

66,Date of stay: July 2021,50,the best quality of service can be inferred from the operator,"I reserved a table for buffet for three different dates, Hazel, the operator, apart from her extremely nice and amicable manner, her patience and cortesy impressed me so much that I determined to share my appreciation to such a wonderful operator who clearly reflected the standard of the peninsula hotel.

Frankly speaking, the excellent quality of service of the Peninsula never falter and my impression never change and furthe confirmed by Hazel. She deserved my every appreciation."
67,Date of stay: May 2021,50,A wonderful and unforgettable stay at the Peninsula Hong Kong,"We stayed three nights for celebrating my birthday. Things were great, and this was definitely a memorable stay!

Special thanks must be given to Marble and Hazel from the front desk team. When we arrived at the hotel, Hazel warmly greeted and took a lovely photo for us in front of a hotel’s signature Rolls Royce. In addition to offering a birthday surprise, a tasty cake, they arranged us a tour to a place that we have been hoping to visit in the hotel. Other front desk staff were helpful, too. On the second night, there was drainage issue in our bathroom. After learning of this incident, the front desk team arranged us another room, which was even more spacious than our original one.

Another highlight was the food and service of dining outlets. Most impressive was the newly opened basement cafe, of which staff were thoughtful and proactive. The team of Gaddis and Chesa were, as always, professional and helpful.

Last but not least, we wish to thank David and Ho from the chauffeur team for the safe journey and their assistance in handling our baggage."
68,Date of stay: July 2021,50,Everytime visit are excellent,This is our forth times stayed in The Peninsula Hong Kong. This is we join the “A TASTEFUL RETREAT” staycation. Including breakfast at The Lobby and a set dinner at Felix. The service is very good. The food and environment t Felix if very good.
69,Date of stay: June 2021,50,Luxury redefined,"Stayed in this hotel for my birthday. The service is seamless and puts a smile on your face. They’ll never forget to greet you whenever they meet you at the corridor, the restaurant or the gym. You can see they take pride in their hotel.

Their room is well kept. I stayed at the suite which is really big for a solo. The only catch is its hugeness means you’ll need to walk all the way from the living room to the bathroom if you really need to sanitised everything (new norm!), which is actually somethingi would tolerate, as it’s so cozy and beautiful!

I love the swimming pool which js heated and 50 metres. The only catch is you might be fooled by the semi open setting in the photos, which is not the case during summer as the glass doors will be closed.

Food was absolutely gorgeous. Ate at Gaddi’s, which is superb and Spring Moon Chinese restaurant is also not bad. I have eaten three different birthday cakes, one at the room, one at the Gaddi’s and one Chinese bun at the Spring Moon. And a beautiful birthday card as well.

I end this stay by taking the Rolls Royce transfer. The chauffeur was nice and drives really well. I’m glad that Peninsula has continued to define luxury experience and will definitely come back!"
70,Date of stay: June 2021,20,Bathroom drain issue,"To start, checked in today experiencing a very standard service, not exactly what I expected from the so call “best hotel in Hong Kong”, or, at least, one of the most expensive one....
After entering the room, the aircon smells like a cigarette stained system. Knowing aircons, I know there isn’t anything they can do about it, unless changing of room.... however, is ok, we didn’t want to be nasty. Let’s just live with it.
At night, when showering, the drain drains slower than the watering from the shower head. Consequently, the bathroom was flooded 2 minute into shower. We ended up showering in the bath tub to avoid further mess.
We asked for the wet towels to be picked up and new sets of towels to be delivered. They wanted to send a technician to check. But no. Didn’t you realize is 1130pm already?
Anyway, we have 1 more night here. Let’s see..."
71,Date of stay: June 2021,50,THE BEST OF THE BEST HOTELS IN HONG KONG,"this hotel was established in Hong Kong 93 years in this year and the building and decor were dated but the maintenance is very good so every time we stayed there, we felt comfortable. the hotel staffs from all departments are very friendly and polite and I specially want to express my thanks to following staffs cos; their service is top notch :
Henry and Hazel from reservation department,
Ada Tung(director of front office): although she is super busy and in executive level, she is humble, polite and friendly. she always greeted me upon my arrival. she also always offered help to me during my stay.
Joyce Fan from concierge : she was friendly and helpful.

one thing I want to complain is their service at lobby lounge : every morning during our stay, we went there for breakfast, this time I stayed there for three nights and had the same breakfast menu which was so boring. on the next morning, they offered fried rice noodle and I asked them if I could change to egg noodle, they said NO. cos' this was set so couldnt change. I admit that this is a breakfast set but I believe it was not so difficult to make such small change, right? considering this is a top notch hotel so they should have a spirit to serve. after I ordered one coffee, I asked for one hot tea, again, a waitress replied NO, because each breakfast only included one drink and since I had already ordered one coffee so could not order other drink.....how come there's only one cup of tea, she said NO. only when I argued with her, she then gave me a cup of tea. it's really ridiculous indeed. actually, last few months, when I stayed here, I requested them to give me one poached egg and one pan fried egg instead per the menu with two pan fried eggs, their staff also said to me that NO, because it was a set breakfast so couldnt change.....it seemed to me that I was having breakfast in a local ""char chan tang"" in which they have a straight rule, which is you can't change anything in any preset breakfast even they can, they won't offer you any change. in this case, we understand and we won't ask for change because we only pay less than 50.-Hong Kong dollars for a breakfast set so what do you want? however when we are now staying in a luxury hotel, definitely we deserve more service, right? ""can do"" attitude should always be driven. luckily on the third morning of my stay, I raised my comment to the manager of the lobby resturant and asked that whether there's any new menu for my breakfast, he responded to me very quickly to offer me different foods from their menu. he is so smart and polite to satisfy my request. here I would like to express my thanks to him hoping that he will educate his staffs not to always say NO to their guests.

other than above negative experience, I enjoyed myself during my stay in this hotel and in fact this time I stayed here mainly to celebrate my husband's retirement and I did asked the hotel if there's any surprise for my husband. when I came to the room on that day, I found a very nice cake with a tailor dummy on top which was specially made for my husband. both of us were very surprised and wondered why they knew my husband worked in textile and clothing industry?? later when I asked ada tung(the director of the front office), she then told me that previously when I chatted with her on phone, I told her abut this so she knew it and then she particularly asked their pastry team to make it and this team was led by Francois and Wilson. here would like to express my heartfelt thanks to them. it really made our stay most enjoyable a memorable. they are all very detailed mind and attentive. sure I will come again."
72,Date of stay: June 2021,10,Very unpleasant experience,"During COVID19, I believe hotel would put hygiene to top priority, unfortunately NO! Clearly can see short hair on the pillow, it is so disgusting!!! Also very dusty on the table. Totally ruined our anniversary! When we check out, a guy come out say sorry, but didn't introduce himself. We heard from front desk, the guy is front desk manager... such a not sincere and not respectful apology, I never had from top tier hotel."
73,Date of stay: May 2021,50,The Best Hotel view in Hong Kong,"An absolutely stunning night spent in a Deluxe Harbour View Suite giving the best view of Hong Kong we’ve ever had. The suite was enormous and impeccably clean with the most stylish of furnishings and beautiful carpets. Incredibly comfortable bed and wonderful marble bathroom with the most relaxing bath with a view. Excellent and most welcoming service received from Hazel at check-in, thank you for looking after us.
Dinner at The Verandah was very impressive with a refined and intimate feel to the restaurant. We’ve eaten in many buffet restaurant in Hong Kong and this certainly is a standout.
Breakfast in the lobby lounge was very good and a delight to be sitting in such a classic setting and Hong Kong’s best hotel lobby."
74,Date of stay: May 2021,50,Flawless,"Flawless! Probably the best staycation ever!
From friendly and attentive staff, beautifully decorated sea view room, the perfect buffet dinner, the stunning indoor swimming pool… the list goes on. A truly memorable experience and we had a great time celebrating my husband’s birthday. We will come back again :)"
75,Date of stay: May 2021,50,Península is happiness 😊 😊,"Greetings, We like to share one of our finest experience in local staycation. Ms. Jean Tsoi took her time over the phone to explain details in every options in staycation packages. Jean is very friendly and nice to us. The food is excellent as always. We had dinner at felix this time. Great view. Abby was so nice and helpful all the time. We had a three bedroom suites this time with marvelous harbout view. Special thanks to Ms. Ada Tung for organizing everything for us to finalize our staycation planning. We enjoyed very much. We booked our ride in rolls royce too. super nice. Will go back again on August.
Kind regards, Ben"
76,Date of stay: May 2021,50,Absolutely an unforgettable stay!,"Celebrated our 26th wedding anniversary. Got an awesome upgrade. Wonderful amenities! Shout out to Ada, Michael and his team, Derick at Verandah & John from Room Service for their impeccable service!!"
77,Date of stay: May 2021,50,For anyone who desperately needs a vacation,"None of us can travel until the restrictions have been lifted, we are not quite there yet... So, we decided to ESCAPE!!

The Peninsula Spa certainly is a great choice, please make sure you have 5-6 hours on the treatment day for your best relaxation. Me and my friend chose the package which is including 2 hours spa treatment and 3-courses poolside lunch.

The couple treatment suite is definitely the highlight!! It’s including a private steam, private jacuzzi for two and of course, the signature victoria harbour view.

Thank you so much!!
- Cynthia and Pinky, both therapists are absolutely amazing, they provided professional and personal service.
- lady staff who served us lunch at poolside, sorry I didn’t get your name, tks for your lunch recommendation, we had a great time.
- Ben, great service!
- Eddie, Special thanks for all the kind arrangement, see you next time!

What an amazing experience, in celebration of my dear friend birthday, in preparation for our new start in June, I recommend The Peninsula Spa.

Thanks,
Elly Wong"
78,Date of stay: May 2021,20,Disappointing experience,"I booked a deluxe room with afternoon tea at the lobby for my birthday. At first, the line of checking in was too long, I was offered to have my check in done at Felix, which is excellent. The room was soso though I can hear buses passing by throughout the night. The staff in the concierge and room service were friendly and helpful. Yet, the worst part is the afternoon tea. The waiters are so rude. They were all like rushing and pushing us to finish our food. The attitude was all despised and arrogant throughout the meal. No one bother to explain what kind of food I was having. I just want to make sure there is no ingredients that may trigger my food allergy. The worst part is that there is a piece of paper in my chocolate cake. I tried to tell a waiter but she seemed to be too busy to care about me. I may look young that might not be your target customer but I do not think this is a good way to treat your customer. I will definitely not visit again. There are much better choices in the market and I can easily name a dozen of places that provided better food and service. Total disappointment for a so-called 5 star hotel."
79,Date of stay: May 2021,10,Disappointed experience,"We had a disgraceful experience at The Peninsula, we finally found the best way to ruin our anniversary.

We arrived and checked in at around 2:30pm (official check-in time to be 3pm) and was informed the room was yet to be ready, therefore, we left our contact at the front desk and had a walk around TST. However, no calls were received until around 4pm so we decided to return and ask for updates. Disappointingly, our room was still under preparation, while front desk has kindly offered us a temp. room for our stay. We stayed at that room hopelessly waiting for updates, at last, we were finally able to get in our room at 5:30 pm. During the temp. stay, we expressed our disappointment through e-mail and received a call from the hotel, we were offered a bottle of orange juice and a ""hotel tour"". However, the so called ""tour"" was just a random staff taken us from the temp. stay to our room. What a joke, the check in process took us more that 3 hrs !!!

As our staycation package included a dinner at The Felix. We arrived at 6pm and was informed the table has to be finished by 7:30pm. The food were soso but the best part was the ""professional services"" by the staff. At around 6:50pm, while having our mains, we were informed by a non-local waitress that we have to finish our mains in 5 mins so that the dessert can be served. Although we have expressed we would prefer 15 mins more for our main course and stated that we were fully aware of the table handover at 7:30pm, however, the waitress did not took that in mind and our mains were forced to be completed in a rush.

In addition, the despised look from hotel staff caused us disturbed feelings during our stay. During our wait of the room, we have shopped at the grocery store nearby and bought some refreshments, which is carried in a plastic bag. I will never forget the stare from some of the hotel staff, I felt like I was not welcomed. As we both still young, we might not be your targeted customers, but these kind of services is definitely not we expected from The Peninsula. We have been to various similar classed hotel i.e. K11 Artus, Ritz Carlton... But never been served in this disrespectful manner.

In general, there are few pros and cons comments regarding the room, dinning and services.

Pros
- Bed was large and comfortable
- Touch screen switches
- Big bathtub that could fit two person
- Great Victoria Harbour View

Cons
- Sanitary provision (toilet paper, shampoo, showgel) was cheap
- Poor sound insulation, could hear traffic easily
- Although dress code was given, some guests were in restaurant with shorts and sandals

To sum up, the overall experience was awful and value of money is low. This hotel is somehow overrated in my personal opinion, re-visit is not an option."
80,Date of stay: April 2021,30,Quite nice but could be better,"Peninsula Hong Kong is a timeless classy hotel with a magnificent lobby & lavish furniture. When we walked in, we were made very welcome.

I have been there for different occasions in the past but have never had a chance to stay so this year from April 8 to 11th I did a staycation there….

I understood the hotel was very busy on that day as it's the start of the Easter holiday however both check-in and check-out were professionally handled and easy. (1 star)

I did not get there in time to eat at all 7 restaurants since its fully booked but I did eat at The Verandah, Gaddi”s and room service if that counts 😅

I rated 3 stars to this hotel because to me F/B is important to me as I like to eat but the F/B was a huge letdown….. the breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all just average sadly so it affects the rating by a lot.

The other thing is the room lacks a music port, we can't use our mobile to play our own music and the bathroom doesn't have a razor and nail file.

The positive side is that there is an extensive array of facilities and it is refined and stylish in all areas for example the poolside and the gym equipment
( Life-fitness) (2 stars)

Lastly, it's a great location, easy to get in and out of the city. (Tsim Tsa Tsui)
If you are a tourist and etc (1 star)

81,Date of stay: February 2021,50,Excellent birthday staycation,"Sure The Peninsula Hong Kong is one of the MUST go Hotel in Hong Kong. It's a colonial-style luxury hotel with 90 years of history. The room is clean and nice, you can operation the electrical lights and air conditioner with just a touch on the pad. The lunch at the lobby lounge and also the breakfast at the Verandah are both very nice. We enjoyed our stay very much ~~"
82,Date of stay: April 2021,40,Excellent staycation package but the food is lacking...,"Our first staycation in Hong Kong and I must say it was awesome. We opted for the harbour view room and the view did not disappoint. We also splurged on the rolls royce pick up. Staff were friendly and professional. The room was very spacious, bed very cozy, and I loved the huge bathtub with television. The bath amenities smelled amazing. The pool was beautiful and an excellent place to relax.

Our package included a dinner at Felix, breakfast at the Lobby, a takeaway afternoon tea set and late check out. It was a great value for the price but my partner and I were both very underwhelmed by the food in general. Food presentation was great but overall out of the 4 meals we had during our stay (we also ate at the pool), we were left unsatisfied unfortunately. We eventually ordered deliveroo.

Overall we enjoyed our staycation at the Peninsula and would even recommend it to our friends. I just wouldn't bother eating there again. It would be great if they could make some changes with this."
83,Date of stay: May 2020,50,Grand old hotel of Hong Kong and a great experience,"The Pen is one of the grand old dames of Hong Kong - we booked for a staycation for landmark birthday and were not disappointed. the rooms are super quiet and every possible thing feels only a touchscreen away. We ordered room service and the food was solid, although not amazing, the breakfast was just so so, for the price, but throughly enjoyed the experience of staying at a hotel with so much history nonetheless."
84,Date of stay: April 2021,40,"A deal for Owls, a ""steal"" for me? This is about room choice","First and foremost I need to be clear that the room we stayed provided clean and top quality furniture and amenities, and all the staff we encountered provided excellent services.

The issue which gave rise to the title of this review concerned the position of suite we stayed during the commencement of long weekend.

In summary, think the old wing lower floor museum facing suites would be a deal for people instending to stay up through the night to enjoy the suite's facilities given it's attractive pricing, but maybe a bit risky for families with young children who habitually rest before midnight. And, as told by the staff during check out, one could request for room further away from other guests who might be hosting a ""party"" if tranquility is preferred.

We got a suite at the lower floor in the old wing facing the museums for this second stay, instead of a suite at higher level in the newer tower which my wife and I stayed 2 years ago.

One of the bedroom wall of this suite at the old wing happened to be directly opposite to the door of another guest room, so I suspect when the other guest room's door was sprung closed the sound would be clearly audible in our bedroom.

This construction feature coupled with suspected ""active"" and ""overly joyous"" neighbouring guests seemed to mean real trouble when the door closing sound came from time to time just when we were about to call it a day and tried to enjoy a good night's sleep (started at around 11pm all the way through maybe 1am).

What more was I heard teens laughing and maybe yelling as if there were playing catch along the corridor, with subsequent abrupt sounds of opening and closing of their room door two or three times in between.

All these resulted in a sleepless night for me (lucky my wife managed to quickly doze off after she was awaken one or two times when the other room's door sprung closed so she didn't need to endure the whole ""symphony"").

When we decided to reserve a suite we assumed the space between the dining and sitting area and bedroom would serve to reduce unwanted sound from the corridor entering the bedroom.

Suppose when the bedroom wall was directly opposite to the door of the other guest room and the guests were active through the night, it would have been better if we just made full use of the suite and party hard instead."
85,Date of stay: April 2021,50,Worth the price?,"Luckily I don’t really know, as this was a surprise birthday present/covid deal. We stayed for 1 night. But what I can say is this is the best hotel I’ve ever stayed in. Is it my favourite? No, but that’s my preference. But its effortless elegance and quality of every aspect of the service, room and facilities mean it has got to go top. Here’s some random things I loved that perhaps aren’t commonly mentioned in other reviews:

- The metallic-tubed shower hair and body stuff that needs to be pierced by the cap to be opened.
- The his and hers opposite sinks. Opposite, not side by side.
- The musical glug of the water down the shower plug hole as it echoes around the marble-walled shower room.
- The TOTAL darkness (if you want it) of the room, even in morning light.
- The quality, user-friendliness and “blend in” nature of the room electronics.
- The pool is the best indoor pool I’ve been in. How they make it Romanesque but not tacky is really impressive.

Top tip - On the sun deck, you might think you want a sun lounger, but you really want a sofa and chair to the left as you move out.

And to show I was at least trying to find some faults, here’s 3, which I’m sure you’ll agree are ridiculously petty.

- One of the 4 coconuts we ordered didn’t have perfectly ripe flesh.
- The pre-heated scones in our take-away were a little crunchy.
- The hairdryer wasn’t a Dyson (I am hooked on my fiancée’s)."
86,Date of stay: January 2021,50,Top notch and probably the best hotel in HK,"Overall our stay at the Peninsula hotel was almost perfect. Both the front desk, room service, valet parking and the suite was absolutely top notch.
My husband and I were pleasantly surprised by the upgrade to the Grand Deluxe Harbour View Suite which made our birthday celebration extra special and definitely a highlight for our stay. A bit unfortunate that we cannot use any of the other facilities given the pandemic. The only thing I’d like to comment on would be staffing over breakfast time was lacking as it took a little longer than expected both to be seated and served. Apart from that it was all good.

The hotel staff were flexible enough accommodate my requests - for example: this included modify the lunch, which was included in the package, from the check-in date to the check-out date. Other hotels tend to be very rigid with their rules especially if it was part of the “hotel package”.

Special thanks to Hazel from Guest Relations served from the front desk during check-in and taking us to our room. She was particularly considerate and professional, taking her time to go through all the details of the room and her can-do attitude was the one who made it all different compare to all the other 5-star hotels I have experienced in Hong Kong."
87,Date of stay: March 2021,30,Great service,"We came for a birthday staycation for 2 nights. Fantastic service, could not be faulted.
Disappointing room size for the price we paid. Uncomfortable bed. Bathroom was average. Water did not drain away in sink and toilet did not look overly clean."
88,Date of stay: March 2021,50,World's best hotel?,"World's best hotel is the claim made by The Peninsula.

We've been to quite a few prestigious hotels around the world, but it was Peninsula that truly set itself apart.

From the moment of the first enquiry over email, to the visit to the facilities, Peninsula truly set itself apart with their speedy response, down to earth service and warm hospitality.

This was one of a kind experience that will be memorable for our lifetime and treasured upon whenever we think back to this very special celebration.

A quick shout-out to Candice from the reservation team, Joyce from concierge, Sumie at the Spa, Ada from front desk, all helped in helping make my wife's birthday one very special, if not the best celebration so far.

Thank you and blessed to be a patron of this fine establishment.

World's best hotel, Peninsula truly lives up to the claim."
89,Date of stay: January 2021,50,Staycation at the colonial hotel in Hong Kong,"Have been there for different occasions in the past but have never had a chance to stay. We bought the staycation package which included 4 meals (lunch at lobby lounge, dinner at room, breakfast at verandah and take-away afternoon tea) and a late check-out until 4pm.

The room itself was modernized and redesigned with wall-mounted LCD remote controls everywhere, including the room temperature, the lights and the curtains. Unlike other 5* hotels I stayed in, there was no need to have a separate fan heater if you felt cold in the winter. The bath has its own TV and controls but it would be good to have a pillow to rest my head like in 4 Seasons or in Upper House.

But I am still puzzled by some of their designs. The TV was inside a cabinet and the cabinet doors must be opened to watch the TV. However these doors could not be retracted inside the cabinet and so that means if you sit at the end of the sofa or on the bed you could not watch the TV as it was completely blocked by the cabinet doors. Likewise in the shower cubicle there was a sitting area but unlike most hotels they would place this pedestal right at the innermost corner, the designer had designed to place it on the corner next to the shower door. If you decide to use it while showering water could just seep through.

Overall I would say a good value for money. Even though the gym and the pool was closed, you could easily spend your time just to admire the history and the design of this almost a 100 year old hotel."
90,Date of stay: February 2021,40,Could be better,"We stayed on Valentine’s Day for one night at a deluxe harbour view suite with the official website Valentine’s Day package, “passionately yours stay experience”. The overall experience was okay for a stay during peak season, but was not as enjoyable as our previous stays at the Pen.

To our satisfaction, the suite was spacious and cozy with a panoramic view of the Victoria harbour. It features a corner bathroom equipped with body jets and SPA mode lighting where one could get well relaxed.

The helipad tour, Rolls Royce pick up service and in room dinner we had this time were great, and the staff who delivered us these service items were all professional and welcoming.  We in particular would like to thank Eric POON from China Clipper for showing us around the mini aviation history museum in the lounge and taking several lovely photos for us on the helipad during sunset. We also wish to thank Ricci HUANG who delivered us the in room dinner.  Apart from delivering the food on time during the peak hour, he professionally set the table up and helped serving the champagne that we brought.  He was even so thoughtful to offer taking photos for us to capture the romantic moment.

Yet, the breakfast and housekeeping service was not as great. Our breakfast choice was limited to a special menu for “package guests” and request for waffle, which we had for breakfast in another stay with official website package before, was denied. Sadly, the breakfast set delivered to us was below peninsula’s usual standard, with the scrambled eggs overcooked and the choco danish, which was served after we had finished all dishes, not warm nor crispy.

Another shortfall was the housekeeping service.  The turn down service, which we requested to be ready in the early evening, was delivered at 21:00, and no clean up was provided for the living room of our suite. When we phoned asking how to use the bathing oil placed next to the bathtub, no one could answer our query nor called back. The room was not thoroughly cleaned, too. There were stains on a chair in the living room and the bedroom carpet. 

After checking out, we shared these issues with the hotel’s management, which promptly responded and assured us to improve. We appreciate front office staff Michelle’s and David’s seriousness in addressing our concerns and hope our next stay would be a better one."
91,Date of stay: January 2021,40,There was still room for improvement,"I went to Peninsula of Hong Kong with my boyfriend for staycation on 31 Jan. I bought around HK$4000/2ppl package, which included free breakfast, lunch, takeaway tea set and dinner, as well as a room with Victoria Harbour view. It was a hight CP value personally.

The hotel was overall good enough, especially the arrangement, service and the food. We had a lunch in lobby at 1:00pm before we check-in. The British Royal design of Lobby was stunning and vast. The original check-in time was 3:00pm, but we could check-in earlier at 2:30pm after the lunch. We got the in-room dinner at 7:30 pm. The food was warm enough. It was really nice. Also, customers were arranged to take the takeaway tea set after 12:00pm on the other day. We took the takeaway tea set to the room at 1:00pm and check out at 4:00pm.

However, customers should consider below disadvantages. First of all, when we got in the room, no anything surprised me. It was just a normal room with Victoria Harbour view. The facilities were not enough in the room. No boiler there in instead of a coffee machine which came out hot water with yellow in color. I was disappointed that no comb there too. Also, soundproof of the room was not good enough. We heard that someone kept yelling from the other room. It was lucky that they stoped until 11:00pm.

All in all, I think it was a good experience in one of the oldest hotel in Hong Kong ONCE.

92,Date of stay: February 2021,20,Sloppy operation,"I held the Peninsula to the highest standard (as it should be) and was disappointed during our stay.

We had the stay and dine package that included 4 meals (lunch, in room dinner, breakfast, and take away afternoon tea). Emailed them one week in advanced to make the reservations of the meal times, only to arrive at the hotel finding that they got all the meal times wrong, and our preferred time is fully booked. The check in process took 30+ minutes, finally got to the room, and found that it was the wrong room (we asked for king bed and got 2 twin), and took another 45 minute to change to the right room. The staff were polite and apologetic about it, so we didn’t think it’s a big deal.

Lunch and dinner was painfully average, we couldn’t finish half of it because it feels like meaningless carb. For breakfast, we got seated without given menus. Finally ordered, and waited more than 30 minute for our food. The people seated after us almost finish their breakfast when we finally got our food! Again staff are apologetic but so far every staff interaction was bumpy and just seemed like it’s a very sloppy operation. Was expecting my take away tea set to be delivered at the time we agreed, waited 45 min, no sign, called and asked, they say it has been at the concierge I need to go pick up. Nobody informed me in advance about it, and nobody check with me after food has been sitting there for more than 30 min.

Room was good, but really focused on many wrong things. For example room has a printer/scanner machine but no usb speaker, has fruits but no drinking water. Toiletries are the absolute basic kinds feel like they don’t even try. On the other hand, There are 3 identical tablet sets to control in-room electronics, trying very hard to look high tech but really adding very little value.

Check out process was unnecessarily long, because they don’t separate check-in and check-out line, everyone is just all mixed together, and no additional counter when line gets long. Was thinking how I should respond when they ask me the courtesy question “how was your stay?”, but ended up nobody bothered asking.

Overall the stay was ok, but for the peninsula, who pride themselves for top notch service, I was very disappointed by how badly it was operated. Staff were all nice but that’s really not enough to deliver exceptional experience when the operation is a mess. They really need to pull themselves together if they want to save their reputation of being one of the best in Hong Kong. Before they do, I’m staying at MO, Shang, rosewood, Murray, upper house, just not the P."
93,Date of stay: February 2021,50,The Grande Old Dame,"Our review of a staycation at The grand old dame. One could argue we are complaining at a very high level here and we can’t disagree. Our ‘first world problems’ really don’t matter in the grand scheme of things but since our hospitality and vacation experiences are recently limited to one night every two months, our expectations are naturally hightend.
Upon arrival, the world famously splendid facade, driveway and lobby live up to their reputation of Colonial decadence and legacy of World’s best hotel. Suitably coinciding with the Chinese New Year, red lanterns and yellow dragons add a nice splash of color.
We can’t help but compare our experience to other 5 star staycations recently completed:
The checkin area, rather underwhelming in its beige tucked away corner. No obnoxious corporate scent cannons, thank you. Great, friendly, attentive service.
Elevators and hallways, polished and quiet but not as sleek as elsewhere.
The room, as expected with splendid views over the world’s most dramatic skyline. However, one third of the south facing windows are blocked with heavy curtains and random demising walls - opportunity lost for even better panoramic views and more daylight.
Unlike other venues which place a chaise or bed right at the window (has Instagram demanded this of other, younger hotels?), the room layout here a bit less optimized: the bed is placed perpendicularly to the window, far enough away to do cartwheels at its base (trust me, I tried).
A recliner off to the side, we moved it to enjoy the view and read. For our anniversary, we were presented with a fruit pizza and afternoon tea - fun, unique, different.
The decor: beige walls, beige upholstery, beige curtains, bronze metal Chinoiserie. We suspect the old dames would love it.
The washroom, splendid in white and green marble and polished silver, almost a bit reminiscent of the oppressive Gringott’s Bank. No bath salt or bath soap, really? Bamboo toothbrushes, cool and unexpected!
Best of all, TV is tucked away in a nice shiny set of cabinets (and not the main attraction like in so many other hotel rooms).
Mini bar stacked with Heineken and Tsing Tao, two of the world’s worst beers. Why not a quality Hong Kong craft brew, call it GOD lager - Great Old Dame?
As pools are still shut, we went looking for better options on the sun terrace. Mission accomplished, a beautiful Hong Kong amber ale, however, served in a neon green frozen jelly mug. Fun for a Nickelodeon themed kid’s party, but at the Peninsula roof top, really?
For vegetarians/vegans, a grand total of one option: seaweed fries, thanks.
In room dining: not much better, hundreds of dishes on offer, none which are marked as cruelty free. Time to get with the times guys. So we order delicious Indian food delivery.
Upon requesting cutlery and plates for two, we are presented with the world’s smallest fork, cute and quite humorous (especially wile forking runny curry) :)
And finally: wireless phone charging and a one button-all-lights-out option on the touch pad command center!
Expectations met: yes, but certainly not exceeded.
Goodnight and sleep tight, grand old dame."

95,Date of stay: February 2021,50,"An enjoyable CNY lunch buffet experience at Veranda, Peninsila - Tsimshatsui","Try it out if you want to experience CNY in HK . You will find turnip cakes, yellow sugar cakes, abalones, CNY snacks , all kinds of NY desserts and food for standard buffets st reasonable price. Full and fun. Recalling childhood times and it’s definitely good experience for visitors . Value for money with decent seating environment and good hygiene conditions. Heartfelt services as well."
96,Date of stay: February 2021,40,Weekend getaway at The Peninsula Hong Kong,"There are few details that I must highlight and share throughout my stay.

Form my arrival, the doorman did approach to the vehicle but with no smile and greeting at all. Of course, none of them ask if we need any assist with our luggage. That was certainly not a warm welcome.

The staff who came to provide turndown service, ring my door at least 10 times in less than 15 seconds. The same situation happens again when I request for another two bottles of water. I am shocked by this kind of approach and I even wonder is there something emergency happening in the hotel. This is a big “surprise” for me during my stay which I have never experienced at any other hotel.
I am not sure if it is because of the high occupancy during the weekend or the lack of housekeeping staff that leads to their rushes. Personally, I don't think that is acceptable in The Peninsula.

After experiencing all the service shortfalls. I finally felt I am staying at The Peninsula until I met the Assistant Manager Rick Chunk at The Verandah.

He is always paying attention to details and providing warm and intuitive hospitality with a smiling cheerful demeanor. I notice that he is also trying to please other customers with his genuine services, so I know it is not just about us. If this is the management who's reading the comment, I would appreciate it if you can pass my words to him. I have no idea of his future plan in his life, but he is great at representing The Peninsula Hong Kong. I hope that he would be around when we return sometime later this year."
97,Date of stay: January 2021,40,Quite nice but could be better,"spent my birthday here. My partner arranged the pre-arrival and the rest so i dont have much information to be shared upon this part.

The package we booked consists of 1 night regular room, and 4 meals, lunch in lobby lounge, 3 course in-room dining, breakfast in verandah, and a take away afternoon tea.

For the room we stayed is the basic deluxe room with courtyard view, it's modern and cozy, a home-feeling room with entrance and a proper segregation and design, very nice for staying, washroom there is tv next to the bathtub , that allows you to enjoy a perfect bubble bath. also with 2 wash basins. The lighting is great with a high tech remote control like a pad in the room, able to control the tv/ lighting/ service related/ call in call out/ in one, convenient. and under pandemic, in room entertainment is very much important as most of the facilities are closed, you can easily connect your moblie/tablet to the TV for youtube or else, user-friendly. i would say this is one of the best basic regular room i have been staying in hk. Sophisticate yet modern design.

For food, i dont have much expectation with this package pricing. and turn out pretty much as i thought, fair and average quality, lunch is ok, in room dining is ok, breakfast is ok, afternoon tea is under average, i understand it's take away, however i dont even have a tea bag, it sounds weird without a tea for the afternoon tea, is it?

For service, again i dont expect too much, concierge is nice, reception is great, just one thing the officer in entrance who responsible to check temperature asking which room we staying in, while we already shown our room card. and ask further question which is bit unnecessary.

Overall, i will rate a 4/5 for the experience, anyway wonderful room and bit pity have no chance to have workout or swim under current situation."
98,Date of stay: December 2020,50,Lovely stay on Christmas,"We got a lovely stay on Christmas Day 2020, which gave us unforgettable moments of this festive season in Hong Kong.

Pennisula Hong Kong is a timeless classy hotel with magnificent lobby & lavish furniture. When we walked in, we were made very welcome. Understood the hotel is very busy on that day however Sally, the front desk staff response us quickly after handled the guests before us. She is just adorable, friendly with warmly touch and care about us.

We had an upgraded room with fabulous seaview & spacious marble bathroom. About the room, the most striking details are the high quality smooth bedsheets and comfort mattress which gave us the perfect sleep.

We were pleasantly surprised by The Verandah, even have few visits before. This is not easy to provide high-quality buffet service during COVID-19. Restaurant set up high standards for hygiene & safety to diners. Waiters were attentive and always serve with smile.

Thank you all staff providing highest level of services even we are having a hard time under pandemic. Add oil!!!"
99,Date of stay: December 2020,30,Hard to explain to my girlfriend,"This is my first stay in Peninsular. Last week I celebrated my girlfriend’s birthday. Pre-arrival, the team contacted me for more information, this is good. After check in, I found nothing in the room so I email the team. A Manager came to the restaurant to talk to me, this is excellent. A small cake was put in the room and taste good. However, overall service does not meet my expectation. First, I expect a better view for this special day, no upgrade and no upsell. Second, no birthday decoration in the room, not even a small logo gift for my girlfriend. This is something even a premium brand hotel will do. Third, food quality was not very good. The steak was slightly overcooked. I guess the team did not take delivery time into consideration (this is common IRD issues in other hotel too). On the other hand, Chinese breakfast is not hot, needs improvement.
My girlfriend asked if I except this in other luxury hotels I stayed and whether I gave specific instructions to hotel. I don’t know how to answer. I don’t give instructions to other luxury hotel, they usually do something on their own to “wow” me."
100,Date of stay: November 2020,50,One of the legend in Hong Kong,"Peninsula has a historical value in Hong Kong. The service level is high. Although she is aged, everything is well maintained. I think she is the only hotel left that still has a cloakroom outside the washroom. Spring Moon and Gaddi are good restaurants."
101,Date of stay: November 2020,50,Anniversary celebration with Stunning view,"We were enlightened that our room was upgraded to Grand deluxe sea view suite. It’s spacious with spectacular Victoria Harbour view. Our kids enjoyed the stay so much with warm water swimming pool and intimate care kids amenities. Food was so yum but we were arranged to sit at The Verandah restaurant for Spring Moon dinner set and The Lobby afternoon tea set. Maybe the meals were included in the package, and we were not normal paying customers. All in all, we love the Peninsula."
102,Date of stay: August 2020,50,Prestige hotel with super good service,"stayed in this hotel three times in Aug, Sept and Oct with family and friends. this is a super good hotel, although it is very old hotel, the maintenance is very good, room is very tidy and facilities in the room is very advance specially their chrome cast system allows guest to watch youtube or netflix on T.V.
also, they have a very cyber penal to allow guests to order in room dining or any service by touching the computer penal.,

all staffs in the hotel are well trained and super super good. i had visited different hotels in the past months for staycation including Island Shrangri-la, Four season, Murray, Upper house... and among all, peninsula is the best.

room is comfortable, food quality in resturant is good, spa service also super good. swimming pool and gym room are also nice !

i particularly want to express my thanks to henry ho and hazel for their food service and hospitality., thank you !

sure i will come again !"
103,Date of stay: November 2020,30,Mixed feelings,"Due to the current pandemic situation, we’ve been having several staycations in Hong Kong including the recent stay at the Peninsula Hotel.

To enhance the experience, we booked a return transfer since they have a special fleet of Rolls Royce. For the most part, it was a wonderful experience except for 2 points which did impact on our stay and sadly because of that, I can not give it more than 3 star review.

The check out time on a Sunday afternoon was barely extended with lots of chasing and following up to do from our end. It was initially extended by 2 hrs and later for an an additional hour but it felt like it had to take a leg and an arm to get approval from the management which was very unpleasant process compared to any other hotels where we previously stayed in HK and never had any problem with a late check out upon request. Their excuse was that our room category was high in demand (for new arrivals from Sunday to Monday which is hardly believable that it would be a full house) and therefore, offering a late check out to us would be quite difficult. How about upgrading a new arrival to a higher (less in demand) room category and offering a late check out to the existing in-house guest - this would easily solve the “problem” and keep everyone happy but it seems that they prefer running everything by the book in old fashioned way while other hotels in our experience are much more flexible and accommodating.

The second issue we had was 2 prawn curries that we ordered for room service. After 45 minutes of waiting, the order arrived which was tasteless and when complained about it, the answer was sorry but there is nothing we can do. I had to email to their GM regarding this issue as they couldn’t solve anything by themselves - unbelievable. I’m sorry but for HK$700, I’m expecting the food quality to be somewhat decent - not below average. 2 days after the check out, we were offered a refund for the curry but unfortunately, it already spoiled the moment and as a result the confidence in the Peninsula hotel as a brand.

It will certainly be a while before we would consider coming back."
104,Date of stay: November 2020,50,A hotel with legendary character,"Stayed there in Nov 2020 for our wedding anniversary. Enjoyed very much with my wife for the 1 night accommodation and dining experience. As one of the worldwide well-known hotels, no doubt for the quality of services, food beverage and facilities.
Would specially highlight few staff members. Concierge/Valet parking - Eric Chan ~ he is absolutely a star, really informative and efficient not only on enquiries but also take care everything for us. Appreciated for his caring.
We experienced a memorable dinner at the Spring moon. Their Chinese barbecue pork (char siu) was superb. The best char siu I have ever had in my life so far. With the excellent service provided by those staff members - Ah Fung (呀峯) and Wyman. They showed passionate on their professionalism. What an evening - unforgettable really.
The Peninsula Hong Kong ~ AWESOME!"
105,Date of stay: November 2020,50,"Classic iconic hotel, nice staff, and very nice bed linen","Smooth check-in, we paid extra to upgrade to a grand deluxe harbor view room. It was nice they assigned us to a room on 27th floor with unobstructed view of the Victoria Harbor.

Our staycation package included afternoon tea for 2, room service dinner, and breakfast. To avoid the crowds, we had our afternoon tea on the 1st floor Verandah. My companion was lactose intolerant, so the staff offered her a fruit plate.

Dinner was served in room, we reserved dinner to be served at 1845, but the food arrived around 1900. Again, they offered a lactose free dinner menu upon check-in, which was a nice touch. I guess it was a busy night, we waited about 1 hour for the staff to collect the room service items.

Breakfast was served in the lobby cafe. We reserved a table for 0900 to avoid the crowds. There were 3 choices, continental, western, or chinese.

The room was nice with a good view. Attention to detail was seen with the plastic mask holders, alcohol wipes, hand sanitizers offered in room at the times of pandemic. Sateen sheets were used for bedding which impressed me a lot and I had a good night sleep in it.

Turndown service was quite sloppy, maybe because we were in the room. There was a blood stain on the bathrobe. The only issue bothered me the most was the dated toilet. It was noisy, took a long time to fill, and it splashed. Considering the room is filled with up-to-date electronic gadgets, but they really need to invest in updating the toilet."
106,Date of stay: November 2020,40,Staycation,"My wife and I spent a night in the Peninsula, thanks to the local staycation deal.

The service is excellent, all staffs are friendly and helpful. Except there’s a bit of confusion on arrangement to outside 7/F podium during evening hour.

The staycation package comes with 3 meals, booking and arrangement were properly made. I can’t say I’ll stay here again as I’m a local, but this has been an excellent experience with the peninsula."
107,Date of stay: August 2020,40,Pleasant 'Staycation' in Unique Hotel,"My Wife and I stayed here for 2 nights, Breakfast included. Among various 'specials', we opted for the Rolls Royce pick up from home. Beautiful vehicle, friendly Driver and smooth ride to Kowloon. Excellent choice.
A venerable old building and a famous HK Landmark. Reception Staff had our Check-in ready on arrival and straight to our well appointed Room with a beautiful Harbour View. Large, comfortable bed, spacious Bathroom. We appreciated the number of USB and charging points available and Free Wifi.
Pool shut due to Corona, but Deck available for Sunbathing and tables in Pool area for a light Lunch. Helpful service from all Staff.
The Lobby was probably awesome when it was built, but style and decor quite dated now and in need of an upgrade.
Breakfast in The Lobby was disappointing. Not much choice, poor quality and slow service. Coffee dreadful (same in every other venue). Day 2 in The Verandah was much better quality and service with nicer atmosphere.
We had 2 excellent dinners - Grappa's and Chesa (separate reviews)
Overall, an enjoyable break in a Historic building, but probably would not repeat it."
108,Date of stay: September 2020,50,"Our second stay in Peninsula these months, enjoyable!","Peninsula is offering different promotions these months. It is rather smart that seldom kids plan or pet plan are found. Avoided terrible mistakes taken by some high-end hotels irrationally.

Very good to excellent in all aspects. Expected what can be expected. Understood the fact there were plenty of hotel guests at the moment and the best arrangements should have been made.

A correct choice for our 11th staycation this year!"
109,Date of stay: November 2020,50,Wonderful Staycation,"We bought a staycation package that comes with three meals. The following are our experiences.

Check-in: we arrived the hotel at 2:40pm and there was no line in the check-in area. Check-in staff are very gentle and polite. We were upgraded to the Grand Deluxe room on upper floor. Room was in perfect condition and was spacious.

Pool: the pool and the deck are gorgeous. Water is very warm. The Victoria Harbour view from the deck is beautiful. Make sure you go there and have a drink. Staff are attentive. We didn’t have time for the gym though.

Dinner: we had the 6-course Chinese dinner. The food and the cooking is not really our taste. The taste lacked complexity in general. Service was excellent though.

Breakfast: we can have a choice of American breakfast or Chinese breakfast at Veranda. We chose to have the American one. Simple but nice. The lady serving us are also very helpful and polite.

Lunch: we can choose to have lunch or afternoon tea at the Lobby. As we don’t like too much sweets, we opted for the three-course lunch. The food quality and the presentation are the best of the three meals that we had this time. Service was excellent. We enjoyed much.

Check-out: the Japanese lady who assisted us was again very efficient and polite.

Overall it was a wonderful experience. We have had buffet dinners at Veranda from time to time but it is our first time staying in the Peninsula in Hong Kong. The service is excellent. It leaves us another good memory from Hong Kong."
110,Date of stay: November 2020,30,Rooms for improvement,"Because of the pandemic, most people are stuck in Hong Kong. Therefore, most hotels in Hong Kong now target local customers. The Peninsula Hong Kong is the 26th hotel I have tried in Hong Kong. She is well-known for its history and service. However, it was quite disappointing as the oldest hotel in Hong Kong and there are certainly rooms for improvement in some areas. First of all, the check-in counter was full of staff during weekends, but the check-in process was still quite messy. Furthermore, some of the room facilities should maintained better, for example the wireless charger was not functioning properly and the shower head kept dripping water. In addition, the knowledge of the staff in housekeeping team should be improve, as they are unable to assist customers efficiently and effectively. The staff also gave me a very distant and cold feeling and they seems quite unfriendly. However, there are still some good points about this hotel. Their staff are well-trained to handle crowds, which most hotels in Hong Kong fail to do so. Their room facilities are kept in a good condition, which seems like a new hotel. Moreover, the washrooms, swimming pool, fitness center and the lobby are very neat and equipped with hand sanitizers. Last but not least, I was quite dissatisfied with the portion of the set breakfast, as it is really not enough for me to fill my stomach."
111,Date of stay: October 2020,30,"Iconic Luxury Hotel, but with Faults","The Peninsula Hong Kong is no doubt one of the most iconic hotels in Asia with nearly 100 years of history. Our Deluxe Courtyard Room assigned was located in the Original Building with the historical forecourt view and a glimpse of Victoria Harbour. The room was very spacious with supremely comfortable bedding and well-equipped room controls.

That has been said, there were some faluts during our stay which were shocking given that it was one of the most luxurious hotels in the world: 1) the toilet water was dirty and muddy even after frushing many times 2) the USB Charger beside the bed was loose, which could be a serious safety hassle.

The overall service was okay, but the F&B was a huge letdown - the breakfast, lunch, and dinner were all just average sadly.⁣

With the recent special promotions, it was also clear that the hotel has reached the maximum capacity - the lobby was packed and noisy; the swimming pool was very crowded with many kids - we could not really swim or enjoy the facility at all!"
112,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Full credit to Donna ........,"..... to be honest .... at first .....unpleasant experience from the first visit.

Thank you everyone"
113,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Excellent Hotel,"We stayed in The Peninsula Hong Kong for 1 night. It was my second time visit The Peninsula Hong Kong after 17 years. The condition of the hotel is still very good and the facilities of the room were upgraded, such as the coffee machine provided, and using ipad to control the lighting/entertainment etc. All the lunch, dinner and breakfast are delicious."
114,Date of stay: September 2020,40,1st staycation with family,"As the first staycation with the parents, we chosen this well-known hotel by all Hong Kong people. Due to the weekend, waited nearly an hour before able to check in. We selected “Taste Around The Clock” Staycation“ package with deluxe harbor view room. The room is big and the view is really amazing ! We can’t stop saying “wow wow wow”.
The afternoon tea time slot was reserved before arrival , so we don’t need to wait. The afternoon tea set is good, especially the scones and the tea is good !
Relaxing and watching the movie at the room is so cool ! The birthday surprise for my sister is really cool ! Thank you very much for the arrangement !
It is able to watch the light show at 8pm directly from the room while waiting for the dinner.
In-room dining for dinner. And the staff helped us to arrange my parent’s table into our room for a good gathering. The food is good , except the sweet and sour pork is too sour and the meat is so hard to eat. It is quite disappointed.
A very good night and the breakfast is at chesa. It is quite good for the western breakfast. However, the Chinese one my parents chosen is a bit disappointed.
The overall experience is cool. If having the meal in the restaurant rather than in room may be a bit better."
115,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Staycation - graduation and advance birthday celebration,"I was very impressed of the service from Philip (Rolls Royce Driver) who drive me and my mother from our house to the hotel, Michelle (Assistant Front Office Manager) for organising my birthday cake, and also the rest of the staff who made my day a special one! I received a birthday card from Donna Lee (Director of Room) as I would like to thank her for her birthday greetings! I really appreciate it!

Wow, I would say that this hotel is one of the best hotel in HK in my opinion and I would recommend to friends and relatives to stay there in the future! Well done!"
116,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Peninsula staycation,"Amazing hotel, with everything top class. The pool was stunning, and the view on the pool was truly beautiful. We stayed in the Deluxe Harbour View Suite, and it was the nicest hotel room I have ever stayed in. The service was excellent! Whenever we ordered something, it would be there at highest class speed. I recommend this hotel to EVERYONE who wants to be in paradise, it is a bit expensive but it is definitely worth the money."
117,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Beautiful Hotel,"This hotel is extremely gorgeous, especially the lobby area where they kept up with the English tradition design. The staff at the hotel are very friendly and because it was our 30th wedding anniversary, they upgraded us to a suite free of charge. Also, they had a little amenity for us too. The package we had included breakfast, afternoon tea or lunch, and dinner for two. It was great price. The afternoon tea was just OK but breakfast was very good.

The housekeeping team was very professional and they were quick to respond to our requests. The valet staff are also very helpful when we needed to find a taxi. I appreciate the staff's diligence."
118,Date of stay: September 2020,50,Staycation,"Covid has stopped us going outside HK. So my wife and I tried staycation at Peninsula Hotel in HK mid September. Everything was excellent with this hotel. The room is spacious and excellently decorated. This is the best I have ever tried. We like the service during our stay. All people there were nice and polite. We loved the classic afternoon tea set.  With the beautiful harbour view, we had the dinner at the room. The foods were very good. Next morning we had a lovely well served breakfast at lobby. The waiter was nice. The atmosphere was comfortable in the morning. But, noon and afternoon it was crowded and noisy at the lobby --- I think the hotel has to do something about this."
119,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Impressed with the room,Peninsula has a rich history in Hong Kong but the rooms are still well maintained. The rooms are also installed with the latest tech which I am impressed. Great rate with 3 meals included and happy with the stay.
120,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Excellent Birthday Staycation,"*SHOULD NOTE: We prebooked and told them about the birthday and everything in advance*

We were 3 and did a staycation for a birthday celebration of two friends. We were picked up with the limo service and it was a great experience, definitely worth trying if you have the option! Once we arrived, Marble greeted us at the car and escorted us straight into the elevator for the in-room check-in. She was very welcoming, immediately wished Happy Birthday to the two birthday girls and an overall great conversationalist. She was very thorough with explaining all the room amenities and features as well as the package recap (we were given a Victoria harbour view suite and it was stunning). Immediately after she left, a room service attendant came with a birthday cake and a lit candle which was a very caring touch, thank you Nancy from Front Office! The birthday cake was delicious and room service was very accommodating about keeping the cake in the fridge until we checked out.
We pre-booked a spa experience and had wonderful seamless service from the moment we were greeted at the Spa Reception with the ginger tea all the way to the massage rooms. We were so well taken care of, so thank you to the spa team. Unfortunately, due to covid the sauna and steam room was closed but the jacuzzi was open so we used that. The team did a great job cleaning up after us so we felt very safe with their safety measures. A big big thank you to our masseuses Sevita, Cecila and Annie who left us feeling absolutely rejuvenated and took very special care of me as I had a skin condition and was a bit worried about any reactions to the products. We absolutely loved the relaxation room which had a beautiful view of the harbour as well.

For dinner we ate at Chesa, we've never tried it but Switzerland is a country very dear to us three so we had to try. The staff there were very welcoming especially Simon, Charlie and Peter Tang who served us all night. They gave us a great quiet table in the corner, the food was absolutely delicious. Very much a full Swiss experience, the Fondue and the polenta is a must try! A special thank you as well to Andreas from Felix who came to wish us a Happy Birthday. We had the apple crumble for dessert which was decorated with candles and birthday messages, the dessert to have if you're not a big cake eater!

Overall, an absolute wonderful stay, highly highly highly recommend spending your birthday here. It's rare these days to see staff so caring in every department of a hotel but the Peninsula did an exceptional job taking care of us every second of that weekend. Will definitely be coming back for another birthday celebration!"
121,Date of stay: October 2020,30,Bad Staycation Experience,"First of all, the front desk gave an unprofessional experience to me. I arrived around 1330 on 10 Oct as my plan was to check-in first and then had lunch nearby, I reminded the front desk that please call me back when the room is ready. At 1530, I didn't receive any call and finally I called back and realized that the room was already ready and my baggage had been sent to the room. If I didn't call back to the front desk, I would be wasting more time.

Second, I requested the room services in 1815, the room service staff was on time, but when I requested him to move the table to be more centre of the window, he said, ""the room is rented by you, you can move it as you like."" (Please allow me to repeat in Cantonese to make it more precise: ""間房係你嘅，你想點郁咪點郁囉"") I felt very bad when I heard what he said, I tried to be calm down as I was celebrating birthday with my girlfriend. I thought he was fresh and not well trained.

Finally, I felt surprised that I waited more than 45 minutes for the Chinese style breakfast. The waiter reminded me that all dim sums were fresh made and it might take a long waiting time. However, I cannot accept that the waiting time was 45 mins, and I used 15 mins to finish it."
122,Date of stay: July 2020,50,Celebrate for Birthday,"We stayed at the hotel suite to celebrate my birthday. The view of the room is magnificent, with Victoria harbour view and can see the Peak at the Hong Kong side. The hotel guest team was so warm that they delivered a birthday cake to our room at night. The indoor pool is so grand and the service is excellent! Highly recommended!!"
123,Date of stay: September 2020,30,Staycation with a disappointing end,"I had a staycation with my family last month. The package included dinner (in room) and breakfast & lunch in The Lobby. We enjoyed the splendid habor view (excited like tourists) and facilities in the hotel. Food and service were excellent.

We stayed in Peninsula Tokyo twice. This is our first time staying in Peninsula Hong Kong. Like previous overseas stay, we ordered umbrellas and some other items through room service as souvenirs. It’s so disappointing that at the time we collected our baggage from concierge, I was asked if I bought those umbrellas (they were still in original packaging). I had never encountered such offensive and unprofessional question in Tokyo (or any other hotels).

We left our baggage to concierge for 3 hours after check out, surely they could have verified if they meant to. So disappointed to have our staycation ended like that."
124,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Staycation @ Peninsula,"Comfortable & beautiful suite. Servers povided professional services. Breakfast, tea set and in room dining dinner also delicious. Swimming pool view is great, in front of sea. It is a good place for staycation."
125,Date of stay: August 2020,40,Birthday Staycation,"Happy Stay at the Peninsula with my friends - booked two nice rooms, had the lovely afternoon tea and yummy in-room dining, staffs are nice (from house keeping, the Verandah, and in-room dining service teams). Brekky at the lounge was great too! Too bad the pool was not open that time :(
Two things to improve - 1. Too many people at check-in, perhaps can arrange online checkin if possible; 2. It’s my friend’s bday and while she has specified this in her booking, nothing was arranged, not even a card or a happy birthday to my friend :( Anyway we had a good girls time there."
126,Date of stay: October 2020,50,Luxury afternoon tea experience,"Tips: Before lining up for the afternoon tea section, you better confirm with the staff for the availability of the Lobby.

I have visited to The Peninsula for their afternoon tea on 3rd October and It was really my lucky day! When my friend and I arrived to the Lobby (1:10pm) and tried to line up for the afternoon tea section, the host of the Lobby has been very kind to direct us to go to Felix instead. (A big thanks to him!!)

We were able to get a table on 2pm in Felix which is located on 28/F with a stunning harbour view! The waiters are very attentive to our need and helped us to refill our tea on time. The afternoon tea set is quite good as well.

Many thanks for the photogenic experience and I really enjoy the harbour view :)"
127,Date of stay: September 2020,20,五星酒店沒有五星水準，名不副實,"整個staycation唯一值得讚既只有fo Doris, 有禮貌同親自跟進我哋房間問題

不足地方:
1.舊翼房間殘舊,廁所有渠臭味
2. Operator冇禮貌,cut客人線，完全冇standard可言
3.去一樓餐廳食早餐，冇counter greet客，見到客人等緊人帶位，對到眼都完全冇行過黎，waiter係面前掂行掂過
4.tea 同in room dining食物水準好一般"
128,Date of stay: September 2020,30,Not so happy birthday staycation,"I had too much expectations that brought me more disappointments.

The room is very hi-tech, yet not so well kept. DVD player was down, the bathroom scale was broken, some spots in the room were dusty.

The room is so dark as it is facing to and blocked by the YWCA building. Insufficient lighting in such a ‘room with no view’ room.
The darkness, that literally made me feeling blue on my birthday.

Some servers at the Verandah were not really nice. When she was setting the table for us, I couldn’t believe she put the cutlery on top of the mask envelope. She also ‘accidentally’ brought a dirty spoon for us. It was an obvious stain. When she was taking order for me, she made me feel not welcoming and limited me from choosing the side dishes and bread. Eventually she arranged some bread we didn’t like. We asked another waiter to see if we could get 2 croissants, he said sure but never gave us.

The Chinese breakfast was below average. Portion was small. Dim sum was really bad. Not even warm, taste worse than frozen dimsum.

I couldn’t believe this is what I had experienced in a so-called 5 stars hotel restaurant.

The only good thing is the desserts are really scrumptious."
129,Date of stay: September 2020,50,Staycation package,"That was a staycation package included breakfast, high tea (or lunch) and in room dinner. I was so lucky to have room upgraded to sea view high floor. It’s so impressive for the Victoria sea view no matter day or night. Very high food quality, including in room dinning. It’s worth to stay there."
130,Date of stay: September 2020,40,A legend with flaws,"So we were finally here, the legendary Peninsula - characterized by its symbolic magnificent fountain and opulent parking of Rolls-Royces at its front, the splendours of its own.

We, as triple couples, were blissful enough to indulge in the ""Taste around the clock"" staycation package, an unprecedented offer from the hotel in the face of the pandemic woes.

Beset with the slew of guests, connecting rooms were not available at the time of check-in, but were promised at a later time after the inclusive sumptuous afternoon-tea. So we went back to the front desk at 16:00, but were told that an hour more was needed to ready the rooms. With our discontents, the hotel swiftly lamented and offered free upgrades on our two connecting rooms, a genuine gesture which we thought was a sovereign remedy.

The stay was inherently a splendid full-board, with a 3-course dinner menu from Western food such as salmon fillet, to Chinese cuisine such as the sweet & sour pork. The highly rated afternoon-tea was indisputably a worthy. Scones were particularly spectacular, so as the signature blends of tea. The utensils looked profoundly British as if they were chronicled with history of the Peninsula and Hong Kong as the British colony itself. The gym was by far the best among the hotels I have been to, though there can be more free weights. There was literally little to decry with such value of foodcation.

In this stay, we had fun, joy, food and wine, and were treated with sheer civility, albeit a little melodramatic emanated from the front desk as we recounted. Perhaps the hotel is striving hard for its reputable acclaim, pushing tired staff over the brink to give overt “sincere” hospitality. Macho staff in suits at other levels of the ground didn’t seem to reach out and care for the guests, especially when we got lost of this hotel at a time.

Anecdotal evidence suggested that the services from the Pennisula were beyond and above, and all the more extraordinary, but in our cases it was anything but a quotidian stay.

Whilst the highly-valued package could not be undermined, we were grudgingly reluctant to score full points for the Peninsula. We expected a little more from the services, especially when their rates are invariably on the high-end under normal circumstances."
131,Date of stay: September 2020,10,Terrible Service - Staycation,"We came to Peninsula for staycation on 2 Sept. The hotel is luxury and nice but we had too many disappointments that surprised us.

Things that you are not prepared (especially check-in) and definitely not expected in an expensive 5 stars hotel. We want to change the lunch and dinner time as the original time was not requested by us (was fixed by the hotel). The only answer we received was this is the best time we arranged for you. No true feeling and responsibility. Further they would never look into if what possible and what not! The service provided in the restaurant was below average. No waiters care of you. We felt only ignorance and arrogance and it ruined our mood and stayed in your hotel and made us very sad."
132,Date of stay: September 2020,50,Good dining experience at the Peninsula today - The Lobby,"Had afternoon tea with my beloved hubby on my birthday (6 sep) at “ The Lobby”.
In addition to the nice food, service was awesome too! We had the delightful waiter & waitress, Carol, Gigi and Jason. All of them were very helpful, cordial and accommodating!

Please also give our thanks to the Manager-Cora, she had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency. She made certain that we had everything we needed!

Thanks again for doing such an outstanding job to make our dining experience so pleasurable, we’ll definitely be back! Highly recommended!"
133,Date of stay: July 2020,50,Luxury experience & wonderful staycation in July 2020,"Excellent service! Everyone in the hotel is very helpful and caring. The Chesa, The Libby and Felix are the highlights of our dining. The suite with stunning panoramic Victoria Harbor View and very huge!

Thanks for the warm greeting from the Guest Relations, Marble and Heidi during our arrival and Executive Chef Terence during our dining moment. My parents have a memorable wedding anniversary and we will definitely recommend our relatives and friends to come!"
134,Date of stay: October 2019,50,The Right Choice,"They took care of every little detail of our stay; from the corner suite facing the harbor, to fixing the mistakes that our wedding planner made.

For some reason our previous posting (2013) disappeared. Software wouldn't allow us to use 2013."
135,Date of stay: August 2020,10,"A very disappointing experience, sorry, but I have to say!","My experience on the whole staycation is very bad! First, there were thousands of people checking in for the ""Taste around the clock"" staycation. Unfortunately the one I bought was the ""Eight Loves"" one, which is more expensive, but I still need to line up together with those people. Secondly, I only received call from the hotel 2 days before my check-in day to inform me that the ""Transportation experience"" that I chose was not available due to the latest government's Covid-19 measures, which I totally understand it's out of the hotel's control. However, i think the hotel should inform me a few days earlier so I have enough time to consider cancelling my reservation before the cancellation deadline. Moreover, the problem is, the hotel didn't come up with any acceptable alternatives to replace the ""Transportation"" experience, at the end I proposed for a room upgrade, they reluctantly accepted my proposal. But honestly I would rather to have the Transportation experience instead of the room upgrade (the room is not as fancy as Rosewood or K11 Artus, it's not even comparable, completely different grades, sorry!). Thirdly, I ordered room service for dinner, it delivered within 30 minutes which was excellent. However, no one came to remove the tray after my request, I had been waiting for 45 minutes, finally the tray was removed. However, after another 45 minutes, someone rang the bell and said he wanted to remove the tray, I told him that it was done 45 minutes ago. How can this happened in a 5-star hotel??? After 30 minutes, door bell rang again, it was almost 10pm, it was a chocolate gift from the hotel, it was nice. However, I just wonder why it can't be delivered when they did the turn bed to avoid disturbances to the guests.
Finally, which was another disappointment, on the day of check out, there were again thousands of people checking in, the staff in the lobby asked me to do express check out, I just need to left my hotel card then they will send me the folio later. It was done quickly per her suggestion. However, my ""Eight Loves"" package included a $500 gift voucher for my next visit, supposedly the hotel needs to give me upon my check out! But the hotel didn't give it to me at all, and I also completely forgot at that time! Of course the hotel didn't contact me actively to say sorry about this, I wonder whether they realised it or not. I realised later and I called the hotel to get it back. They promised on the phone to send back to me by mail. I checked out last Sunday, today is Friday, I still haven't received my $500 gift voucher! I think the hotel should have the responsibility to check what package benefits that the guests are entitled to, and make sure the guests get what they bought. Instead of waiting until the guests find out and claim back from the hotel. It looks ugly! There were still some other small bad experience which I didn't want to talk about anymore!
I did my staycation with Rosewood and K-11 Artus. In terms of hardware and software, Rosewood is world-class, is extraordinary. The hardware of K11 Artus is excellent too, software is normal. The price of Rosewood/K11 Artus and the Peninsula are comparable, however, the whole staycation experience is totally not comparable at all. They are of different grades! I booked my staycation again with Rosewood in coming December to celebrate Christmas! For Peninsula, I won't go back anymore!"
136,Date of stay: August 2020,10,Much room for improvement,Very Disappointed at how my dinner on my second day of staycation was completely spoiled by the staff who misplaced my food order after a long wait of 45 mins! This is to me unacceptable by the standard of Pen which has been taking pride in its superb and impeccable service.
137,Date of stay: August 2020,50,Excellent Service,"The staffs are very polite and well-trained. Even though we visited in a very busy week, service is still excellent. The Peninsula is great because of their professional staffs.
A hotel with such a long history is still very modern with iPad control panel of all the lighting and curtains and sound.
Location is great and convenient.
Highly recommended."
138,Date of stay: August 2020,20,Staff did not know how to manage expectations,"Maybe I’ll change this review in the future but the staff in charge of afternoon tea need to have better and clearer communication with guests. We arrived at 2:15 (relatively early given that high tea begins at 2pm) and when we asked for a table: the lady asked if we had made any reservation. I said no because it’s clearly stated that you cannot make one and you have to walk in. And she said ‘that’s right you need to book a room to make one’. So why not just asked if we were guests at the hotel in the first place? Anyway, we were told the earliest available table was at 3:30.

We didn’t want to wait around for more than an hour so we decided to drive to the Rosewood nearby that happily took us in without any such trouble. We are now seated and they call us at 2:40pm to tell us a table is available. Too late. We really enjoyed our experience at the other restaurants at the Pen so maybe we will try again next time."
139,Date of stay: January 2020,50,How many times have I been here over th eyears? Such memories.,"Love the elegance. High Tea is so, so good. Centre of the universe with guests from everywhere. And the fine dinning. Right on the Harbour. Easy access to Star Ferries. So much great shopping within easy walking distance. For the adventurous, a comfortable walk to the famous Jade Markets."
140,Date of stay: August 2020,50,"Brilliant view, amazing rooms, relaxing stay","We stayed in this hotel for a night. When we checked in, the receptionist was very welcoming and very attentative. She personally take us to the room and show us around the room and how things operate.

The harbour view room is amazing and massive. I loved the idea of the bed facing the window. So when you wake up, you will see the amazing view of the harbour. It is really relaxing. The bathroom is elegantly decorated with high quality amenities provided. The complementary birthday cake that they have given us is very yummy. It melts in your mouth.

It is a pity under Covid majority of the facilities are closed. However it is still a very enjoyable and relaxing stay. If you are a runner, pls take advantage of the promenade and go for a run. It is a joy.

We have in room dining and their staff was amazing. They arranged everything for us so that we can sit properly to eat. They even remind us that you can call them and pick up or clean up after you finished dining. They even volunteer to take a picture for all of us. It just feels like we are eating in the restaurant.

The transfer using their Rolls Royce is a must do. The chauffeur is very polite, dress immaculately and have great manners. They will wait till you disappear before they leave.

The manager of the concierge was smashing. Pennisula should really make him employee of the month. It is him, that makes the stay so special particularly for my nephew. As he takes my nephew to see an old Rolls Royce (only him). My nephew was so excited and delighted. The manager is so considerate and nice. He is very humble and friendly.

We did have lunch in the Lobby and the food and service was great. However when comes to breakfast, service was a bit slow but the food was still very yummy. The food and beverage manager was keen to listen to our feedback and was very apologetic. Thank you.

The Japanese restaurant in Pennisula is fantastic. Fabulous service and tasty food.

Overall loved our staycation and would look forward to come back."
141,Date of stay: May 2020,50,Lovely birthday,"Booked a special event stay and were pleasantly surprised with a lovely welcome dessert. At check-in the staff noticed that we were celebrating a birthday and surprised us with a lovely cake and hand-written birthday card. After check-in, she took us for a tour of the room which was helpful. We were also offered Asian soup and tea which were brought to the room. A welcome fruit platter was awaiting us on the table that was in front of a huge window that gave a brilliant harbour view.
Housekeeping was efficient and friendly.
There were a lot of things that they did very well and were simply just thoughtful. Full-sized individual foam hand sanitizers because of COVID.
Toe-less bedroom slippers are great in summer.
Ziploc bags and lens wipes for your upcoming flight.
Hair-tie with the shower cap for long hair.
An eraser in the drawer along with other business amenities.
Definitely feel that you're well taken care of.
Highly recommend."
142,Date of stay: July 2020,50,A special stay!,"After living and working in Hong Kong for 4 years, I decided to spend my last evening at The Peninsula in Hong Kong. The service and facilities were excellent and the staff members were extremely friendly and accommodating. A big thank you to Thomas and Hazel who were particularly kind! I visited Felix (restaurant and bar), and I couldn't have imagined to experience a more spectacular view during my last evening in Hong Kong.
With its history and charm, The Peninsular Hong Kong is a very special hotel. It will always be my favourite hotel in Hong Kong, and I look forward to visiting you again when I return one day. Thank you!"
143,Date of stay: July 2020,50,Amazing staycation,"Thank you so much for your hospitality during our stay. We appreciate all the services you provided and the way your staff members were helpful, friendly,and organized. We really enjoy it.
""Loves of The Peninsula Hong Kong"" so amazing..."
144,Date of stay: June 2020,20,Disappointed family Staycation,"We checked in on 28th June for two nights to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We recieved a small plate of dessert which we really appreciated. We were told the swimming pool is really packed due to covid 19, only 15ppl can be accommodated. So we went to the pool with my 5yr old child right after checking in. By the time we get there, should be around 30ppl there in such small venue, the floor is very slippery because it is made of marble, no caution sigh nor any advise from the lifeguard, saw a few of them tried to wipe dry the floor, who think of this genius idea because it is useless, you fell because of the water dripping from your own body! My child was getting out from the pool then in no time, she fell head to toe, hit her head straight on the marble floor. My husband nearly fell on the ground too. The hotel offer us some ice and was told the nurse would come around after 3 hrs to check on her, I monitored my child closely and waited. The nurse was lack of patience and we never received an apology from the hotel on the day it happened. My child was so scared and refused to go back to the pool. We asked to check out a day early and refund for a night because it is pointless to stay there after such incident, then the answer was impossible. So we decided to check out a day early even though we paid for it! Such a huge disappointment for peninsula hong kong, it was a 6 star prestige hotel long time ago but now it has downgraded to 3 star service."
145,Date of stay: June 2020,50,Truly remarkable,"We had the best stay, beginning with an impeccable Rolls Royce pick up. Highly recommended bucket list. The team surprised us with an upgrade to a suite and the birthday cake & card was one of the best we’ve ever seen. We’re Platinum members of other hotel chains and this the first time we’ve stayed at a PH. Truly, you’ve won us over. Best of luck & may you continue to be one of the best globally. We also really enjoyed watching the short film on the hotel’s rich history. Well done!"
146,Date of stay: June 2020,30,Afternoon Tea,"I visited the Lobby Lounge today for afternoon tea. I’ve been to the hotel a few times to go to the other restaurants (all outstanding, Felix in particular) but today felt rather lacklustre. The scones and tea were delicious but the savouries were a little hard and uninspired. I also found the service to be rather lacking - we had to ask for water and quite a few other things which was a little unexpected at such a high calibre establishment. I searched for a recent review of the afternoon tea here before I went and couldn’t find much so just thought this could be useful for those considering it."
147,Date of stay: June 2020,50,Good service,"Dear Peninsula Team,

I have some good comments for this hotel, when i came to peninsula lobby at the morning on 1 june,2020 .
On that day i have a afternoon tea and early to come and take a photo.

148,Date of stay: May 2020,50,The One & Only,"We love the hotel and love coming to it again and again whenever we have staycation and travel on a business trip as the hotel makes us feel like home away from our home. The team is one of the most professional! Every single staff we came in contact with are very welcoming and friendly since we first stepped into the hotel, and we surely wouldn’t book anywhere else. Compared to all the 5-6 Stars hotel’s we stayed across the globe, The Peninsula Hotel HK is above the rest! Well done TPHK!!!"
149,Date of stay: May 2020,50,Luxurious and Traditional,"Came across the Eight Loves of The Peninsula Hong Kong Staycation Offer. Due to the pandemic, instead of going abroad for a vacation, we opted to spend our anniversary at one of the most iconic hotel in Hong Kong and it certainly didn’t disappoint. Our trip started off with a pick up from one of their amazing Rolls Royce. Check in was done privately in our own room and we were surprised by chocolates and a letter congratulating on our anniversary! We also met our extremely nice and fun pastry chef who taught us how to make the signature butter cookie and put individualized icing patterns on top (one of the eight activities to choose from). Relaxing from the pool and breakfast in room with dining credits to spare are just too much to mention in a tripadvisor review. Don’t you think?
To sum it up, if not now, when? For anyone who wants to visit Peninsula Hong Kong, the time is definitely now!"
150,Date of stay: May 2020,50,Amazing attention to details,"Spent our Mother's Day there because of a promotion. Originally I was quite indifferent as to going or not, but my mother was curious to see what, if anything, made Peninsula stand out from other 5-star hotels. And upon the first day of our stay, we had the answer: attention to details.

I shall perhaps preface this with the fact that the facilities and environment at The Peninsula were also superb - but that is kind of the case at every 5-star hotel, and I wouldn't say it is the most luxurious hotel I've been to (it's not - and it's also not geared towards luxury vacations, so it is of no consequence). But there are many things during our stay that - while it would have been fine if not done - were noticed and done by the staff, which made us very comfortable. I should also mention that it is probably one of the most high-tech rooms I've stayed in - almost everything in the room are controlled by touchpads/ through an iPad, which is incredibly helpful.

For example, the room design. The desk drawer has stationary such as stapler, scissors, adaptors etc., which would be very helpful to have if I were on a business trip. The TV channels include news channels from all around the world (instead of just local channels like many other places), in many different languages, which again, would be much needed if I were an overseas businessman/ tourist staying here. The TV sound also automatically turns of when I received a call on the room phone. There are facilities that would allow me to comfortably start a video conference from my TV/ living room area. Plates and utensils were available in the room in case I wanted to eat the fruits they provided. The air condition is almost silent. A screen wipe is placed next to my laptop when I came back after housekeeping. I can go on and on, but it's just the small details that stand out, and I would not hesitate to recommend it, especially for those on business trips.

And of course the standard 5-star services were offered. Staff were always attentive and ready to help, even before we asked. A mother's day dessert plate and two welcome notes were in our room when we entered. Tea was delivered immediately after check-in. A birthday cake was brought the next day, as it was my mother's birthday this month (by the way, it was delicious). Food-wise we only had tea at The Lobby. It was great - not the best I've had, but worth it - and I especially recommend the finger sandwiches. My mother and I loved the black truffle sauce so much we called back to ask where they got it, but it was homemade and not available for sale.

Lastly, I just have one small recommendation. It would not be something worth mentioning to another hotel, but since this one seems to strive for perfection on details - the flush of the toilet is a bit noisy. My mother is a light sleeper and, while I managed to get to the washroom without waking her, I did not manage to flush the toilet without waking her, even with the bathroom door closed.

All in all - fantastic. Definitely recommended for business trips, and great for vacation also (since HK is not for beach holidays, anyway). Thank you for making our stay wonderful."
151,Date of stay: May 2020,30,Services,"Went there for mother’s days weekend. Crowded but still have a smooth check in. But a few points to be improve:

Front desk: Natalie said there’s a welcome drink included however not one brought to the room even though she asked me to pick the drink. I also asked the baby bed to be remove from the room which did not happened. A little disappointed to start off with.

Room: It has a nice view, 99% clean. There’s a red string on the luggage rack, and for 2 days no one clean it up even I put rubbish next to it. The rubbish was cleaned up but the string was left alone.

Facilities: The good news is that their pool and gym are opened with limited guest every time, which is acceptable due to the current situation. Staff are nice and clean up the machine after use. Pool floor is a little slippery with wet foot and I nearly slip. But overall nice environment and friendly staff.

In room dining: I had one breakfast at the pool and the other one send to the room for my friend. Overall the breakfast were very nice, we’ve found a molded raspberry inside the fruit platter, but in room dining staff handle it pretty well and offer us a new plate or juices as replacement which we decline cause we are very full.

As for lunch the next day we had club sandwich, it was send to the room on time, but food was a little cold, sandwich bread was little soggy. The staff had a little attitude when I order hot water and honey to the room and there was a big “bang” noise before the phone cuts off.

We haven’t had a chance to visit the restaurant inside the hotel as we have a little baby with us. Overall the experience was okay and we enjoyed our stay."
152,Date of stay: May 2020,50,Fabulous Cobb Salad & Service,"A great lunch experience complimented by fabulous service by Gigi and the team; and a friendly chat to Ariane. Cobb salad was delicious, service attentive and atmosphere lovely. Will be back again in the near future."

154,Date of stay: February 2020,50,Perfect Anniversary Stay,"The hotel is well located at Hong Kong. It is convenient especially for person who love jogging. After completion of jogging, staff will try their best to give me the water. This small thing make me love peninsula hotel.
My room is grand deluxe harbour view room. The harbour view is wonderful. Both day and night! It is one of best hotel stay in world.
There is my wedding anniversary stay for this. It make me and my wife with unforgettable memory. I shall revisit this luxury hotel again! Thanks."
155,Date of stay: February 2020,50,Lovely Hotel,"Most beautiful, comfortable room ever! I had a beautiful harbor view. Stayed during COVID19 so several restaurants in the hotel were closed as well as the spa, pool and gym. It was actually nice to just hang out in my beautiful room and relax. Breakfast was really good and the bar with the view for the light show was great too! Great location, shopping in the basement and across the street. Super friendly, nice service."
156,Date of stay: March 2020,50,"PHK : Luxurious hotel, amazing team","We chose to stay here for (3) nights and straight after booking, PHK customer service (CS) team has been prompt and attentive with my questions/concerns.

Because of COVID19, original flight was changed, hence, travel dates had to be changed as well and CS has been so easy to correspond with. They even reply to eMails after midnight.

The day before my flight, Rimowa luggage lock was stuck and they gave me details of where it can be brought for repair. At check in, I didn't have to go to the store -- front desk staff requested the technician to come up to the room to fix it. Very helpful after nearly 11 hours of traveling.

We were surprised with gifts in our room as we were celebrating a special occasion --- and we were treated to a Deluxe Harbour View Room. We enjoyed the Symphony of Lights show from our room --- the wide windows offered the best view!

Early morning of our 3rd day (1 night left), power in our room went kaput. Shortly after I phoned around 5AM - someone from housekeeping, an engineer and the night manager made sure that we weren't so much inconvenienced. We were moved to a new room --- UPGRADED to a GRAND DELUXE HARBOUR VIEW SUITE!

Superb service from everyone and special mention to Night Manager, Glenn!

Thank you, PHK, for making our stay super special and more memorable - despite COVID19. We will definitely be back!"

158,Date of stay: February 2020,50,Fantastic,The Peninsula hotel is by far one of the nicest luxury hotels I have stayed in recently. Upgraded to a suite which was like a small apartment very clean had everything in it. The service was impeccable staff very polite . There luxury car service was first class. So impressed we have booked the Peninsula in Manila on our next stop.
159,Date of stay: March 2019,50,One of the famous hotel in the world,"This hotel is one of the mythic Hotels in the world and it is true. We
spent one week and I couldn’t find something wrong to say about our stay. The rooms are modern with everything connected by an IPad near your bed. The bathroom is very large. There is a stunning indoor swimming pool, the restaurants are first class. A stay in this hotel is expensive, but it worthwile. Buffet at the Veranda’s is extraordinary , and so is the breakfast ! You can ask for one of their 14 Rolls-Royce to come to meet you at the airport. Smart !"
160,Date of stay: January 2020,50,Luxury Hotel with Incredible Service,"The Peninsula is a gorgeous Luxury hotel. The lobby is spectacular. The room was elegant, and luxurious. The service is INCREDIBLE. I broke my foot in a fall on a cruise ship. We went to a Hong Kong emergency room at midnight. Around 5:00am we called the Peninsula from the emergency room. Could we check in early? Not only did they let us check in at 5:30am, they upgraded us to an elegant, handicapped room. The night manager, the check-in specialist and two assistants met us at the taxi with a wheelchair. They brought a cane and a walker. I explained that my foot was broken and I needed a light-weight chair to move about the room. The night manager gave me his own wheeled office chair. They provided delicious room service. The concierge arranged for someone to shop for a cane that I could use on the airplane. The breakfast area was attentive and brought me anything I wanted from the delicious buffet. When we checked out, the Rolls Royce limo took us to the airport. A butler and a wheelchair lady met us at the curb. The butler guided us through customs and luggage. The wheelchair lady took us to our gate. Astonishing service to meet us at the curb at the airport.

The Peninsula is a high end luxury hotel. We rolled around the shops area, just to explore. Most of the shops were closed for Chinese New Year. Need a $10,000 purse? No problem. On the first floor, just off the lobby there are at least three diamond stores. Cartier, Harry Winston, Clef and Arpels are available for all your diamond needs. Astonishing wealth on display. We were a bit intimidated as this was totally out of our budget. But it was fun to look."
161,Date of stay: February 2020,50,Service at the Grande Dame of Hong Kong sparkles under great duress.....,"It has been said that you can best judge the quality and integrity of a person when they are under duress; well the same could be said for a hotel. Neither protests nor the Coronavirus could stop the Peninsula from providing legendary service. With the city buckling a bit, the Peninsula staff conducted themselves with the utmost poise during our recent 12 day visit. The service separates the Peninsula from the rest. Sherry at the concierge desk was very attentive and took care of restaurant recommendations, flight reservations and shipping arrangements--sparkling, gold-plated attention! When I did have a problem, they addressed it quickly and overdelivered in making it right. Very touched and impressed with their grace under pressure. Won't stay anywhere else in Hong Kong."
162,Date of stay: October 2019,50,10/10 Service,"Beautiful property in Kowloon, directly opposite Hong Kong Cultural Centre, Former Kowloon-Canton Railway Clock Tower & Avenue Of Stars. Around the corner from Nathan Road and a short walk from Canton Road and Star Ferry Pier.

The service at the hotel was exceptional and their team were available every step of the way, literally, I was calling them from Sydney as we were concerned about the situation in Hong Kong they were great with updates. Hotel is very grand and formal (a dress code is set in place for most of the hotel.)

Beds are massive and felt a lot bigger than a standard king. All rooms have iPads on either end of the bed for easy access to changing lighting, opening/closing curtains, quick access to restaurant details, room service, etc. They also had USB charging ports + wireless charging pads in the draw which I found wonderful. Honestly felt like royalty..

Hotel offers a great buffet breakfast with many choices/styles of food."
163,Date of stay: January 2020,50,"Great hotel, excellent location, friendly staff","We booked a suite on this hotel
The service is amazing, when we arrived our checking has been made in our room
We had also a welcome tea and some snacks on the room
The room was excellent, huge and really comfortable
Everything can be control by a tablet, Beds are really comfortable
The pool, facility is great and also I would suggest to order lunch on the pool, the quality is really good and tasty
The breakfast is the only thing I consider has to be improved, in this kind of hotel you expect more selection, but it is ok
The offer was not good
But service on the peninsula, and location is excellent
Also I would remark the staff was great, really nice and helpful
If you have the occasion book a suite, it is great experience
Definitely Peninsula it is a great hotel for your Hong Kong stay.
Do to miss it, it is a classical hotel but really charming"
164,Date of stay: January 2020,50,The only place to stay,"We stayed at this iconic beauty for 3 days. We are a family of 6 and had 3 grand deluxe rooms overlooking the river.

The rooms are absolutely magnificent, enough cupboards to unpack and place your suitcases. Everything a traveler could require is in the room and we loved the tablets that remote controlled the room. My kids loved the TV in the bath.

The location is perfect. Close to everything we wanted to visit and we loved strolling on the promenade fo K11 Musea.

The trip to dinner in the Rolls was fun and a lovely treat.

Our family chartered the hotel boat to watch the Lazer light show and this is an absolute must do. Watching it from the middle of river is completely different to watching it from the hotel. It was certainly an experience I will always remember.

The restaurants were all very good, I had a great blow dry at the salon and the gym was probably the best hotel gym I have ever been too.

I only had two small issues..... one was trying to get a cappuccino at 06h30 in the morning and the other having just arrived from a month beach holiday in Thailand was my Birkenstock’s. We arrived fairly late in the evening and had planned to buy closed shoes the following day but initially I was asked to change my shoes before being allowed into the downstairs cafe. I had to explain I had no other options before being allowed in.

All in all a wonderful stay with outstanding service."
165,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Excellent service in Hong Kong,"Big thank you to Peninsula Andrew Chau, Guest relations, Hazel, and Concierge Michael at my last stay in HK, which was quite some time ago. Andrew got a hold of my profile maybe 10-20 years ago when I was a frequent guest at Pen in their specialty suites. They remembered everything, which was extremely impressive and made a special warm welcome! This was spectacular attention and researching! Thank you to the Management especially Mr Antony Wong in Central as Director, Operations who managed to retrieve my info from the system after all these years and especially to Andrew Chau~ excellent services!"

Room design is best of the best , although not very big. Equipment is excellent, especially tablet to control everything, including in-room dining, super convenient , in our room there is a laundry closet , we can put in our stuff if laundry service is needed. Their staff can manage them without coming in our door at all.

Curtin design is the best we have ever tried, it isolate light from outside almost 100%. It makes both of us had a very good sleep, and Light design is very good, can be controlled by tablet as well

In-Room dining was very delicious , we tried vegetarian burger and Chinese breakfast

One more thing, room guest can make reservation of afternoon tea (exclusive for room guest), otherwise need to wait , first come first serve"
167,Date of stay: January 2020,50,The queen of the hotels in South East Asia,"Great hotel. Mainly for the building and reputation. Perfect personal assistance. Although an old and famous hotel every thing is quite modern (usb loading stations, remote control of everything,...) Fabulous public areas and corridors. Style! Also very centric location, in front of the boulevard of the stars and ferry to Hong Kong island."
168,Date of stay: December 2019,50,Most iconic hotel in HK... A great experience,"I think no one will dispute that if one has to choose the most iconic hotel in Hong Kong, The Peninsula is the choice of most. Taking advantage of the special holiday package we decided to spend a night here in the end of Dec, to experience the fantasy of this amazing hotel.

Originally we have reserved the Deluxe Room but upon check-in the staff asked whether we are interested to upgrade to the Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room, with an additional surcharge. Seeming to be a great deal we landed on the room on the 25th floor of the new wing, with a gorgeous view looking at the Victoria Harbour.

The room has a nice contemporary design, featuring a small dining table and chairs in front of the window, a chaise lounge, a super-king-sized bed, a writing table and a make-up table. Everything is comfortable and top-notch, offering guests a really pampered, relaxing stay.

Another feature of the room is that everything is controlled by a tablet, from the blinds and sheets opening, the air-conditioning, dimming lights. There is even wireless charger for your mobile phone on the bedside cabinet. Convenient and high-tech.

The bathroom is spacious with two basins, so you don't need to worry or fight in the morning for the use. There is also a rain shower as well as a bathtub. Comparatively it was less impressive on the facilities here.

The package also included breakfast for two at The Verandah, and honestly it was one of the most premium breakfast I had, with lots of high-end ingredients and the service was also impeccable. No wonder many people did come specifically for it.

Another feature which I found memorable is the limousine service. Also included in the package, guests can ride on their Rolls Royce fleet from or to any destination in town. And that experience alone is something unique and worth paying for.

Overall I would say the whole stay is great and the service is truly amazing. The different restaurants we visited are also very good. Just that the hotel is so popular you might find it a bit too crowded in the lobby and restaurants. But once in the room everything is back to quiet and peaceful.

Room charge (for two) $4,268
Room charge supplement $1,400
Service charge supplement $140
Dining credit ($800)"
169,Date of stay: February 2019,50,Memorable trip,"The location is perfect, room facilities are comprehensive. No frills and everything designed and seen to detailed. Breakfast buffet was superb. The staffs always paid attention to our needs and very friendly."
170,Date of stay: January 2020,50,No doubt this is the best hotel in the world,"This fantastic old lady continues to deliver wonderful rooms fantastic service and a wide variety of food Comparing with other hotels is Pointless this place sets the standard

I can also say having sampled some of the competitors their crown is safe"
171,Date of stay: December 2019,50,“ Grande Dame of the Far East”,"If you read all the reviews about this hotel on the Internet, your expectations will be pretty high. Yet even so, they will probably be exceeded by the experience.

We were accommodated way ahead of our check in time, greeted by name upon arrival and quickly ushered up to our room where fresh apples were waiting for us. Within a minute of arriving we were served tea to go with the apples. An amazing way to be welcomed.

The room featured all sorts of unexpected surprises, like a fax/copy machine, an integrated TV above the bath, top of range coffee machine, full set of stationery, two sets of gowns.. coasters that pull out of of the couch, proximity sensitive touchscreens through the room... not enough time to explore all.

The heated indoor pool, we must have missed this in the marketing materials: they play beautiful tunes under water! You hear nothing above the water, you have to submerge - and the party starts.
You are greeted on arrival, fresh water is brought to you (after your pool slippers of course).

We attended the Afternoon Tea. There are plenty of reviews online. They’re all true. Fresh ingredients, delicious preparation, attentive staff, live chamber music, tea served in silverware... long queues of awaiting patrons (booking way in advance is highly recommended).

A truly memorable experience."
172,Date of stay: December 2019,50,Ms Tam,"Stay one night with family on Christmas Day. We are invited by the manager Mr Au Kit to join the Boxing Day party at 7th floor just during we ate having breakfast on 26th morning. Surprisingly, there are magic show, cake making and presents to kids at the end of the party. We would like to thank the manager Mr Au and those ladies helping the kids to make the Gingerbread Man!
Once again, we thank the team to arrange the Boxing Day party for us ! Without the invitation from Mr Au, we definitely will miss such happy gathering and joyful memories! Thank you."
173,Date of stay: December 2019,50,"World class, with a query","There can be no doubt about the greatness of this iconic hotel. The location, service and rooms are world class. The Christmas decorations were encasing.

My query is why are the best hotels are adopting the rort of ""paying in your home currency "". It's adds up to 7% to the bill and is never disclosed Great hotels should not do this without disclosure."
174,Date of stay: December 2019,40,Would not return,"Spent two nights there this December. Our room had no view. The only good room feature was the bed and the bathroom. Tub was huge with a tv.
Valet service was good.
We asked for late check out we were told no. We also asked them to store our luggage one night while we slipped over to Macau they said no.
So for the amount we spent to stay there two nights I was not impressed with the customer service."
175,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Deserving of its outstanding reputation,"This grand, historic hotel would usually be outside of our budget range for a quick city trip, but the disruption in Hong Kong has had a serious effect on the tourist industry.
The hotel is everything that one would hope for - and more.
The decor and comfort levels are wonderful- the Christmas decorations had just been put up when we arrived and they were simply glorious!
The food was perfect in every way and the afternoon tea (we had a party of six) was a delight! One guest is vegan, three are vegetarians, one is allergic to fish and seafood. All of us were not only satisfied, but we were unable to finish the delightful array of scones, sandwiches and pasties. The champagne flowed and the Peninsula Bear even visited us!
My only criticism is that the hotel does not have an ATM (they do their own currency exchange and their rate was very fair); a member of staff, however, escorted me to the bank just behind the hotel to withdraw from the ATM and waited with me whilst I undertook my transaction. Nothing is too much trouble for them and they thoroughly deserve their stellar reputation."
176,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Fabulous Afternoon Tea,Had a wonderful afternoon tea at this beautiful hotel. Magical surroundings and exquisite service. The quality of the afternoon tea was superb and without fault. If you are visiting Hong Kong this should be at the top of your “ must do “ list.
177,Date of stay: December 2019,50,Exceptional Hotel,"We stayed for four nights in December. I took my mum and the first day was her birthday. She did not want to leave. We were collected from the airport in the beautiful Rolls Royce and well looked after by helpful friendly staff. Able to give us a very early check in which was wonderful to have a sleep after a very long flight. Upgraded to a beautiful harbour view suite. Just a stunning room and the best view in the world. Check in in the room and the staff had arranged a lovely in room breakfast for our arrival. The room has everything you could possible want and the staff are fantastic.
My mum was delighted to receive a bottle of champagne for her birthday and later at turndown the most tasty cakes. Each evening the room is beautifully turned down and treats left. Breakfast every day great as were the staff who looked after us very well. Enjoyed cocktails in the bar and grand afternoon tea on the Lobby. Bag of freshly baked cookies when we left in our Rolls Royce transfers. Helped by staff at the airport to beat the lines due to passport checks in place since the protests. I had high expectations for The Peninsula but they were far exceeded. Thank you for looking after us so well. I hope I can return."
178,Date of stay: November 2019,40,High Tea at The Peninsula,"I have heard so much about The Peninsula. So when we were planning a trip to HK, I told my husband that I would absolutely love to have high tea here. And it just so happened that it was my niece's birthday, so we all went to high tea at The Peninsula Hong Kong. Yay!

No table reservation. We lucked out and got a table right under the balcony where all the musicians were playing. Quite loud, but for the most part, it was enjoyable. Then the food started coming and it was so beautiful. Trays of finger sandwiches and petite cakes and scones. Really fancy.

The service was good. They also packaged our leftovers (a lot of leftovers) in a nice fancy box. I took that to my other cousin's work place and she probably shared the goodies with her coworkers. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves."
179,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Simply perfect,"We spent one night in the Peninsula to celebrate a special event. We have lived in Hong Kong for forty years and though we have enjoyed restaurants at this hotel many times over the years, thought being guests would be a treat, however we underestimated just how big a treat this would actually be. We stayed in the old, original block and have never been in a hotel room that was so perfectly appointed - everything, including many items never thought of by other hotels, was where it was expected to be and though it was renovated six years ago, careful maintenance has kept the room in tip top condition. We enjoyed afternoon tea in the Lobby, a sumptuous dinner at Gaddi’s (a long time favourite) and the buffet breakfast - we’d be surprised if there are any better breakfasts in Hong Kong. The staff was friendly, polite and attentive. We are grateful to the Peninsula and are still congratulating ourselves for making such a good choice!"
180,Date of stay: December 2019,50,Impeccable service & experience,"Coming from NYC to HK for holiday & mistakenly reserved the wrong arrival date via Agoda. Contacted the Pen HK reservation agent and explained the situation & then called Agoda & explained I spoke with the Pen. Agoda tells me they would contact hotel staff & get it amended in 48 hours. I was nervous because I would be on the plane by then. Thankfully, everything worked out!! Arrived via taxi & I was given early check in. A++. Jason at reception was excellent and upgraded me to a higher floor. All Pen staff I encountered were friendly & outstanding. Staff maintenance is impressive. However during my stay, the fitness center and changing room area were closed for renovation so you have to go upstairs to the spa and then down stair again to use the spa facilities. It was annoying seeing people workout at the pool area when you just want peace & quiet. My room included the breakfast buffet. Service and breakfast food were great. Why stay at the Pen? The room is definitely one the highlights along with housekeeping. They really think of everything. One thing I miss from my prior stay at the Pen is the welcoming arrival tea service but there is a machine in the room that you can make your own tea now. Overall, we loved our stay at the Pen. There are so many outstanding hotels in HK, but Pen is extra special. Will 100% go back in the future."
181,Date of stay: December 2019,40,Excellent Hotel,"I have always wanted to have a taste of staying at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. Because of teh present troubles in Hong Kong, hotel occupancy was said to be down, and prices of hotels are now much cheaper than before. Lo and behold, even the Peninsula is affected, with price having come down by about 50%, so on my recent trip to Hong Kong, I decided to stay there.

What a wonderful experience. I was met at the reception by wonderfully helpful people. They upgraded me to a room with a view of teh Harbour. The room was spacious, a bed one could dream of having at home.

Being a guest of teh hotel, I have priority booking for the famous afternoon tea at the lobby, which, even with the present troubles, there was a queue!

During my time in Hong Kong, I felt safe. A taxi driver advised me- as a tourist, just keep your mouth shut, and don't comment on anything vaguely to do with poltics and no one will trouble you.

One more thing, the malls were empty and the sales people extremely courteous and helpful.

So this is a good time to visit Hong Kong, and stay at the Peninsula!"
182,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Lifetime Experience,Excellence personalized service was rendered once arrived at the hotel lobby. The hotel room is fully digitalized and the welcome chocolate inside the room is truly unique. The Peninsula Hong Kong is my best hotel experience thus far.
183,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Excellent hotel,"Dear The Peninsula Hong Kong,

My wife and I have a wonderful stay in your hotel! The room is perfectly clean and tidy and neat! The service provided by all of the staff is incredible, they are all polite, attentive and customer caring. The Front Desk personnel, the Housekeeping staff, the Waiters and Waitresses, the Telephone Operators, all are providing a very warm services, making us feeling ourselves at home. The facilities inside room is amazing, makes everything easy to control with just a touch! We are very satisfy and will definitely come to visit and stay in your hotel again.

You, THE PENINSULA HONG KONG is excellent !!!"
184,Date of stay: September 2019,10,Disgraceful service and a shame to its heritage,"In short, stay across the block at the newest property and don't bother with the Pen. Don't even visit. (The lowest floor there is higher than the highest floor at the Pen. Even the afternoon tea there is miles better than at the Pen.)

I booked via Amex FHR for a 3 night staycation at the Pen. I know, many people have access to FHR and it certainly doesn't make a guest special. Perhaps that is why the hotel made me feel unwelcome from the moment I arrived. They kept (at least 10 times) saying that I booked through Expedia instead (with a tone of strong emphasis), as if I should be very grateful that the doorman actually opened the door and allowed me in.

The so-called Kowloon skyline view is a joke. It faces nearby buildings at a very intimate distance. Compared to the Kowloon View which we checked out later at the Rosewood, where it was panaromic with every hill and skyscraper in sight, it was truly breathtaking. None of this at the Pen. Imagine staring at chimneys and exhaust vents and sketchy rooftops and people living through their daily routines straight through your window. The windows were also narrow and dirty.

The room itself was tiny and uncomfortable. I have heard that it was designed to be like a yacht. I'm sure yeah, that includes the seasick part as well. That's exactly how I felt in the room. The room that I was assigned to didn't even have a couch. It is a joke (as some of my friends said after I posted on social media, '[Penin] feels like an Ibis compared to the RW') and no one should ever pay hard cash to stay at an inferior option.

The hotel was averaging at 30% occupancy (which I checked and confirmed with the staff - and also an available figure through its public filings) throughout our stay period, yet the staff refused to honor better room upgrades when I said I was dissatisfied with the view and would like to see if they could arrange for anything more comfortable. Instead at first they wanted to DOWNGRADE me. What kind of customer service is that? A nice gesture could go a long way such as making me enjoy my stay more and pay for additional amenities and service, so it is a zero-cost and profit-only decision.

Yet, my expression of dissatisfaction of the room did not result in any acceptable resolution. Firstly, I was willing to offer a co-pay as I was so sick of the room I was assigned to. Yet they went hardline and quoted me a price that was even higher than the difference if I booked online at the spot. The manager on duty could not offer an explanation. He just kept repeating the same absurd offer and I lost count of how many times of 'NOs' and 'CAN'Ts' I heard from their team over the phone.

When I figured that it was better to move to another hotel, I asked if I could just cancel the stay and leave. The hotel management actually gave me unimaginable responses such as 'I'm not sure if you can cancel' / 'We can't really do that' etc, offering zero help or understanding of the situation, nor any attempt to relieve my frustration (if a guest has checked in and spent the past two hours over the phone with you, you can probably guess how frustrated he is).

What sealed the deal was when the duty manager, in a rushed and agitated tone, actually exclaimed over the phone 'If you don't like it here, you better get out of here' / 'We don't want to welcome you here either, thanks but no thanks', phrases like that. Anyone with the slightest bit of hospitality training (even at a 3-star hotel) would know that you should never confront a guest let alone verbally threaten or escalate with them. How can someone with such an intoxicated mentality cling onto a hospitality role in one of the most competitive cities when it comes to the luxury hotel scene? I just cannot believe it.

Throughout the ordeal, despite they knowing that my agent (Amex) was based in the US, the hotel staff also offered zero help in letting me call overseas. I had to spend a lot of time and money out of my own pocket to suddenly summon up my travel agent, of which it wasn't easy at all relying on my own mobile phone rather than the hotel's phone or communication systems. When I asked for help the hotel staff similarly turned a deaf ear.

I felt like I was in a trap and started getting panic attacks. I had actually felt that uncomfortable in the room. I told the hotel staff I wouldn't be comfortable leaving unless I had received confirmation from my travel agent (since the Pen staff weren't willing to help) that I could leave the hotel (and since the staff suggested that 'might not be allowed'). They started knocking on my door every 10 minutes to see if I needed baggage assistance. I thought someone was outside my room door all the time ready to break in and evict me. I thought the hotel would be calling the cops on me soon. I was so terrified and frightened and intimidated by this whole experience. Can you imagine, the supposedly jewel of the crown in hospitality of the entire Far East making a guest (that has already prepaid) suffer that way?

When I checked out, it was late in the evening already and the lobby was virtually empty. There were at least four front desk agents and four doormen, plus two more bellboys. When I was waiting for my pickup, and throughout the entire departure process, none of them bothered to ask about my stay, or feeling, I felt that I was treated like I was invisible despite a 10:1 staff: guest ratio at that time. No eye contact, no conversations, all staring and poking on their phones or chatting amongst themselves in very close proximity to me.

I moved to the R-C where despite using a corporate rate for less than half the price of the Pen, they were more than willing to accommodate me and extended a four-category upgrade to their room with a best positioned view despite booking under 30 minutes' short notice. I was warmly welcomed by two of their front desk team plus their duty manager. Now that was actual hospitality and service, rather than intimidations and confrontations (loved it so much that I actually extended my stay by another two days at the end. And the view is no comparison at all.)

Ironically the Peninsula front desk team had asked me the purpose of my stay and it was more than obvious to them that I was there for a staycation. Instead of trying their best and pulling extra efforts to please a local guest that could bring in repeat revenue, they actually proactively went the other way. Having said that, I've done staycations at a handful of the Peninsula's peers in the same recent period of time and each and every one of them would easily beat the Pen in terms of hardware and software in every corner, not kidding. Particularly the newly opened one just across the block which (as someone staying 100+ nights in hotels in the past couple years) can confidently say that it is currently the best city luxury hotel in the whole world. The Pen can't catch even 1% of it no matter in terms of hardware, rooms, views, service, and everything essentially. Not surprised, as apparently some of the best staff there were poached right here from the Pen.

Even within Peninsulas, I've stayed at other Peninsulas in the world in various locations and each and every one of them had done an excellent job in gathering pre-arrival information. Here, there was no pre-arrival email at all, instead I was 'warmly' welcomed by repeating how I 'booked through ***Expedia*** (emphasize)' dozens of times, leaving me puzzled. Of course, following an abrupt early departure of a guest, the hotel management/staff couldn't care less, and there was no feedback or further follow-up to at least figure out what went wrong. (Would have been easy given the low occupancy and nature of the situation anyway) It's really a shame that the once grande dame of hotels of the entire Far East, and a hospitality brand that has made Hong Kong proud around the world has fallen such great levels in its locale flagship. I don't even want to set foot in the hotel again, it evokes such level of trauma in me. It's probably not hard to figure out why the hotel has to indefinitely suspend some of its F&B services while the competitor property across the block has been opening one after another new restaurant with very high acclaims and satisfaction and popularity from guests. I am at the same time heartbroken to see the positive impressions I had of the Pen (of which I've supported its dining and retail establishments for 20+ years, just haven't happened to stay in) end up in such shambles.

If the Peninsula has at least the slightest thought of hospitality and customer centricity in mind, they would find out who I was and email me to follow up (of course, it should have happened unprompted 2 months ago.) Still, I'm betting that they would either ignore this review, or just type in a vague templated response 'sorry we let you down blablabla', or even worse, in maximum irony, 'we should have trained our staff' or 'please email us to tell us what went wrong'. I mean, I've already told you everything here. And you had 90 years of history and reputation to not fail in such epic extents.

All fellow TripAdvisor community members, stay away from this trap and harrowing dungeon. Please. As a local, reach out to me and I will personally show you what the best hotel in Hong Kong is like (the newly opened one diagonally across the block from the Pen) instead."

On of few remaining legendary properties in HK, with great sense of history, rooms are spacious with good amenities. Lobby is grand. Location is very good. Strongly recommend to stay atleast once"
186,Date of stay: October 2019,50,Honestly something special,"Fortunately (or unfortunately, depending on your view of work-life balance), I tend to travel a lot and stay in many hotels around the world. However, I have to say that the Peninsula is something special!

The rooms are very impressive, from ipad controls for the lights and curtains, to amenities I haven't even thought of - a printer in the room? check. nail dryer? check. etc. Even that little box by the door to leave your shoes so that someone can pick it up, polish it and return it to you without disturbing you. Wow. When they offer to show you up to your room, I recommend that you accept it because you do need someone to explain everything to you.

The service was also excellent. Upon arrival at the room, I immediately asked for a room change (I prefer rooms away from the lifts due to the noise), and the service staff immediately sorted it out for me. She was also really friendly during my entire stay, and I only regret that I didn't get her name at the time so I could pay her a proper compliment.

The breakfast buffet is also excellent, although very expensive (I had some guests for breakfast and paid through the nose for it).

Which brings me to the last point. Luxurious and amazing though it is, it is terribly expensive, so be prepared..."
187,Date of stay: November 2019,40,Birthday Staycation,"Stayed in Peninsula for the birthday stay, spacious room and appreciated the unique features for Peninsula ONLY - In-Room Entertainment System, Bathroom Amenities, etc. Hardwares are nice and you can control everything by using the special digital control pads next to the bed or the writing desk.

For the service, not really impressed."
188,Date of stay: October 2019,50,Afternoon Tea at the Peninsula,"We went there for an afternoon tea on one Monday afternoon. The decor and atmosphere there is very classy and elegant. The service was really excellent. All waitors were so friendly and attentive. Whenever we had any requests, they responded very promptly. Our table was near another room that was under renovation. After we were sitting there for an hour, we smelled something from that room. They arranged another table for us right away and gave us another set of drinks free of charge. There was a group of musicians playing classical music in a balcany. The atmosphere was truely relaxed and brilliant."
189,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Wonderful location with even better service,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights on a month long trip through China and Japan. It has the best location, right next to the largest most high end shopping I have ever seen, across from the river and museums and ferry. Our room was large and very well appointed with a show stopping view of the river! It took my breath away when we arrived in the afternoon and again at night with all of the incredible lights on the buildings on the other side of the river. I think our receptionist, Anna at the Peninsula in Shanghai had communicated with Tony in Hong Kong and he arranged for the beautiful room for our anniversary.
Jasmine, the concierge, also was very helpful in getting our boarding passes for us and even came running to us as we were leaving to help let the taxi driver know what airline we were flying!

This is a fabulous hotel with obviously a great staff to guest ratio. Everywhere there is someone waiting to help you. It made for a wonderful memory in Hong King!"
190,Date of stay: October 2019,40,Fabulous View and Wonderful Staff,"We arrived at the Peninsula Hotel without a reservation but the staff could not have been more helpful. They called the restaurant and we were accommodated at a pleasant table but were warned that it was not best placed for the view. We still had a good view and were moved to an excellent position when other diners moved. You could not fault anything other than the cost of the food and drink hence the four star rating. The starters were small, albeit tasty, but at c.£58 for a steak you would expect some sides. They were separate and expensive as was the drink, so our two course meal and a drink cost just under £300 but you could forgive anything for that view!"
191,Date of stay: November 2019,50,Grand Dame of Hong Kong,"We were on a cruise that completed its journey here in HK and were picked up in the Peninsula Rolls Royce from the cruise terminal across town which was lovely. Check in very smooth and our room was ready which was great. This hotel is very luxurious and deserving of all of the plaudits it gets. However there are some reservations from me about this visit, the things that are currently closed which we were not informed about ( the American Bar, very disappointed not to use this bar, closed for renovation, the gym also closed for renovation , had to work out by the pool, not great even in the early morning sunshine, far too hot and the upstairs bar at the Felix which is one of the highlights for me - closed for renovation). The staff as always are first class, anticipating your needs and really excelling themselves. When we arrived we were given a card with info on it should be get trapped anywhere due to the protests - we didn’t need to use this as no protests on a week day, but very thoughtful. Also a special mention to the Concierge, my husband left his phone in a taxi and they managed to track it down for us and the cab driver (bless him, honest people are still out there folks!) returned it to the hotel. So grateful to the Pen staff for this. The rooms here are what you would expected from this level of hotel, luxurious linens, comfortable beds, tea and coffee machines in room, lots of gadgets to play with (to close curtains, etc.) and really lovely decor. Yes I would stay here again, but I wish we had been informed about the renovation. We did not try the afternoon tea as it’s not the sort of thing we do, but if you like it, then this is the only place in HK that you should consider doing it. Not cheap though."
192,Date of stay: December 2018,50,THIS IS THE HOTEL,"Peninsula is the best hotel in Hong Kong for decades!! The view, the rooms, the restaurant 5stars! Also the tea in the lobby in the afternoon is a must see and be!

the staff is always there to take care of all your needs! to all my 350,000 readers , if you ever in HK please visit the Peninsula!"
193,Date of stay: August 2019,50,Otherworldly,"The Pen was a fantastic host from start to finish. The signature Rolls Royce airport transfer includes not just a car journey but a royal welcome at the front door and private check-in up in your room.

Standard rooms are large for Hong Kong and the first impression is the classic but modern design. Lighting, heating, housekeeping and room service requests etc are controlled by bedside tablet. The room is full of hidden features and storage akin to something found on a luxury yacht. A delivery of fresh fruit, tea and confectionary arrived shortly after arrival.

The breakfast buffet comprised a huge selection of international foods and was faultless. We had a drink in the downstairs bar on our first evening and felt transported to a different time. Dinner at Spring Moon too was phenomenal and service very polished.

Huge thanks are due to Henry and Marble who arranged a tour of the hotel for my friends and I. We were taken behind the scenes to learn about the history of the hotel and we enjoyed this immensely.

This is a fine hotel and one deserving of its reputation."
194,Date of stay: October 2019,50,First Class $1928,"Everything is PERFECT.
Room - Perfect (Thank you for the attendant (forgot her name) who service our room, her smile is unforgettable
Service - Perfect (Thank you concierge Sherry and Joyce helping us to plan our two days vacation. First Class concierge!
Spa - Perfect (Thank you Dennis, the best massage I had tried in HK)

The best hotel in HK, maybe is the best in the world."
195,Date of stay: October 2019,50,Stunning Hotel.,"What a way to finish an epic holiday. Beautiful hotel with stunning finishings. If you like older style, colonial type buildings then this is the place for you. Airport pick up in the Rolls Royce the ultimate treat for my husband. Efficient and smooth check in took place in the room which was nice and personal.
A BEAUTIFUL cake was arranged for my daughter to celebrate her 10th birthday which was a couple of days before. A lovely personal touch forever to be remembered.
The beds were so comfortable and the little touches of the turn down service always make us feel so luxurious. The pillow spray mist was a highlight - maybe we were exhausted but we slept like statues for hours.
The pool complex is stunning. No photos due to privacy but think Grecian and style with the HK skyline in the background."
196,Date of stay: September 2019,50,Anniversary trip in Hong Kong,"We've been travelling to Hong Kong for four to five years in a row now and while we've been to Peninsula for afternoon tea, the Bar and dinner at the Verandah, we haven't stayed at the hotel before. We've usually stayed in other five star hotels in Hong Kong. This time we decided to book three night stay in Peninsula's Grand Deluxe room. We were celebrating our anniversary with this trip and it was wonderfully taken into notice by the staff.

Due to the recent events in Hong Kong we also decided to book their airport transfer service, just in case, which resulted in a really elegant welcoming and check-in experience. By the time the car arrived at the front of the hotel, we were immediately greeted by Jennifer (if I recall correctly), who greeted us by our names and took us to see our room and do the check-in there. Everything went so smoothly and we didn't have to sit and wait around in order to get settled after our long flight.

As a part of our celebration and being foodies, we took part in their Culinary Journey and it was truly a unforgettable experience. Our host, David, did a tremendous job in telling us about the history of the hotel and the whole Peninsula brand while having his personal touch in keeping us entertained. We truly appreciated him trying to get to know us more and we had lovely chats with him.

David did well in introducing us to the restaurants and other staff. We want to give an extra mention to Leo from Felix who also took really good care of us during the Journey, which ended up us booking a table for the Felix Brunch the coming Sunday at that time! The people in Spring Moon were also wonderful, especially the tea sommelier who served us some exquisite teas.

We visited Felix for three times during our trip and each visit was really high-class. The brunch was really great, especially the sea food, and their bar served good drinks. Give Felix a visit just before the sunset and experience the amazing atmosphere it has during the evening time.

Do give the poolside area visit if you have time. It's a really amazing and beautiful place to sit down and relax for a while.

We already had high expectation from Peninsula, but they managed to go above and beyond, making it one of our favorite hotels in which we will definitely stay again in the future."
197,Date of stay: October 2019,50,Ultimate Luxury Plus,"I have stayed at The Peninsula before, and I have always had the temptation to return to it if occasion arises. My business visit to Hongkong this trip at a chaotic time is such an occasion, as the hotel lies in a relatively safe area from rioters. To add to it in such a time, the hotel offers a transfer to the airport where high security is being enforced and with the help of the airport concierge I passed the queue in far less time. But even if at peaceful time, this landmark hotel is a must for anyone's occasional indulgence. It has the most state-of-art facilities in the room that has few peers in the trade (and I did take advantage of the room's full ranged office equipment). And it is an experience to relish once again its luxury, even though I am a returned guest. And at this hard time for tourism in Hong Kong, you may profit from paying less for the ultimate level of luxury."
198,Date of stay: October 2019,50,Afternoon Tea,"What a perfect way to finish of a perfect day. We had the most amazing weather, clear and hot to take the red line big bus up to the peak. Once back on Kowloon we dropped by the Peninsula to see if we could organize afternoon tea. It was a Tuesday afternoon around 3pm and they had a table. We were going to go back to our hotel and change out of our shorts but they said we were ok as we were. Mind you they did put us at the back of the room 😂!

There is live music being played in the background and lots of people just wandering around, taking in the opulence of the hotel. We started with a glass of the Peninsula champagne, ordered the tea we wanted, then the three tiered plates arrived. Just lovely, the sandwiches and scones with raspberry jam and clotted cream were delicious.

We stayed at the Peninsula 35 years ago and it was nice to come back and enjoy time with friends over tea. Its a real treat but worth doing."
199,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Truly luxury,"This is a long-overdue review. However, I would like to share with others on our wonderful experience of staying in The Peninsula Hong Kong. Easy access to anywhere within a short distance. Breakfast buffet had one of the widest spread of food and beverages I ever had anywhere. The restaurant at the lobby might get crowded as some patrons were public who walked-in to dine. They changed the mini-fridge in our room immediately after informing them that it was not cold at all. Overall a good class luxury hotel."
200,Date of stay: October 2019,10,Unprofessional Concierge Staff - Joyce,"I expected that all the staff in The Peninsula are perfect or at least with good service.
However, I would say an agent call ‘Joyce’ definitely violate my concept and perception.
Early this week, I approached their concierge and check about the opening time of their bar which I planned to meet my business partner there. Joyce told me is 5pm but actually is 5:30pm......
Very bad experience and unprofessional as I have to ask my business partner wait for 30mins....
She doesn’t feel that she did something wrong even I reapproach later on the wrong info.....

Honestly, thats should not happen in Peninsula."
201,Date of stay: October 2019,50,PENINSULA GIVES RISE TO OLD MEMORIES,"On the 10th October 2019, l accompanied my husband to a short business meeting at the Lobby of Peninsula Hong Kong. These were my observations......

1. Cosy environment with romantic music. My husband and I used to enjoy afternoon tea and evening cocktails at the Lobby when we lived in Hong Kong at least 10 years ago. Once we sat down for just a cup of tea really reminded us of our tender moments there during our courtship.

2. Good service. Staff seem to know of prior business dealings with the previous General Manager Ms. Rainy Chan, but were certainly helpful and courteous, regardless.

3. As Palmiers are our favourite delicacy of The Peninsula, unfortunately, its cake shop was closed at 4:30pm, instead of 7:30pm. Since we are living overseas, we have to either order these delicacies online or visit the shop next time when we are in HK.

4. Security staff are very attentive and standing guard at the Lobby during our business meeting there.

We will definitely come to The Lobby for the signature afternoon tea next time when we are not rushing for our business meetings at The Peninsula."
202,Date of stay: September 2019,50,Understated Pure Luxury.,"The Peninsular in Hong Kong has been on our bucket list for many years. We have visited Hong Kong on a number of occasions, however this visit presented us with an ideal opportunity. We had finished our recent cruise in Hong Kong and could have stayed on board for an extra night, we however elected for a night in the Peninsular. We were not disappointed!

On arrival we were greeted at the hotel front entrance by the uniformed bell boys and escorted to the reception counter where we checked in. We had previously booked a Grand Deluxe room, Jennifer on reception then escorted us to the 20th floor. At the door Jennifer informed us that she had upgraded us to a suite........and what a suite, Superior Harbour View. It was absolutely fabulous with amazing views of Hong Kong harbour. To add to the event a bottle of champagne and hand made chocolates were delivered shortly after our arrival.

The rooms are so well appointed that it would take forever to write a full description. Best advice, stay there at least once. It certainly wont be our last visit.

We had booked in for afternoon tea in the lobby, the photographs do not do it justice, everything is so well presented and the attention to detail by all the staff is outstanding and discrete.

We very soon began to regret not staying for longer.

However, the last leg of our journey to the airport was facilitated with a transfer in one of the Peninsulas’ green Rolls Royce. Yet again the service was immaculate as was the vehicle. We were met at the airport by a hotel representative who took our many cases and escorted us to check-in.

The hotel stay and airport transfer was the highlight of our trip. As previously stated it will not be our last visit to either Hong Kong or the Peninsular Hotel it is now a firm favourite."
203,Date of stay: September 2019,50,Fine hospitality,"The Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong is a fine example of luxury service, accommodation and food. The service is attentive and the staff is well trained and absolutely accommodating. For a hotel professional with a master from Cornell University, such service quality to be so consistent over our week stay is inspiring. I wish I had such staff in nyc.

On the first day of arrival we had a lot of laundry and dry cleaning that was delivered all done three hours later on a Sunday. Their Chinese and japanese restaurants are outstanding and have Michelin star rating. Their breakfast and lunch buffet has a variety of food and a quality that is delicious in a beautiful setting that is very popular with guests and locals.

The bedroom amenities including their iPad control for light, curtains, temperature is most up to date in technology and very well thought about.

We had a marvelous stay and will visit again"
204,Date of stay: June 2019,50,best hotel in hong kong if not the world!,"This is my favourite hotel in hong kong if not the world! amazing for business, amazing for vacation and amazing for taking a partner to! absolutely have to have a harbour view to see the amazing views of hong kong! everything about this hotel is pure luxury!"
205,Date of stay: June 2019,50,Pure luxury,"Was lucky enough to not only have my room ready very early in the morning but an amazing suite over looking the water. Hazel Tang from guest services checked us in and her attention to detail was unlike anything I have ever experienced from any hotel in the world. Fresh flowers in my favorite colors were sent hours later, chocolates and endless gifts were sent ever day. I truly felt like a princess. I have stayed at eight out of their ten properties and many of the four seasons properties through out the world as well and no one ever has made us feel as special as Hazel did. Our friends came a week after us and Hazel welcomes them at the entrance with gifts for their young child. This alone has made this hotel our number one choice in Hong Kong and the only place we will stay when we return."
206,Date of stay: August 2019,50,Excellent visit for my dads 70th birthday,"I recently stayed 3 nights at the Peninsula hotel as a treat for my fathers 70th birthday.
He had wanted to stay for over 30 years, since first visiting Hong Kong.
His dream was to be met at the airport and taken to the Pen in a green Rolls Royce - so that’s what I arranged.

From the moment I booked, I knew the staff at The Peninsula would make our stay memorable.

When we arrived, we found a man holding a Peninsula sign, and made ourselves known. He led us to the famous green Rolls Royce, and drove us to the hotel, which took around 40 minutes.

I had chosen a Harbour View room, which was fantastic. The view was amazing.

The staff had prepared a welcome for my dad, including a custom cake - my dad is wheat intolerant, so they had made a cake out of watermelon slices! He was very pleased!
Also a chocolate Rolls Royce.

One thing to keep in mind with the view: The window can get covered in condensation if the air conditioning is too cold! (We visited in August: it was very hot!)

The breakfast at the hotel was also top notch.
We thoroughly enjoyed it both mornings we had it, lots of choice.
Breakfast does close at 10am, which I felt was a little early, and on our second morning, we were slightly rushed to finish.

We were also invited to view the hotels vintage rolls Royce, which was very interesting.

I used the gym, which was well equipped.

There is an outdoor terrace for sunbathing, but no outdoor pool.
This didn't pose a problem for us, but I know my wife would have liked an outdoor pool if she had visited.

I would have no hesitation in recommending The Peninsula hotel to anyone.
Fantastic location, service and staff."
207,Date of stay: June 2019,50,"Amazing, Amazing Hotel",A stay at the Peninsula is an experience. The hotel is beautiful. The rooms are luxurious with fresh fruit and sweets waiting for you when you check in. The breakfast buffet is incredible with a mix of Eastern and Western choices. You will never want to leave the indoor pool. The service is impeccable. I loved staying here.
208,Date of stay: August 2019,50,Amazing in every way,"I travelled with my wife and daughter to Macau and Hong Kong to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We stayed at multiple hotels in our trip just to relax and spend time to play with our daughter. I'm usually too busy to write a review on Tripadvisor but I feel compelled to do so this time, because I have to say, out of all the hotels we've stayed in this trip, the day we spent at the Peninsula Hong Kong was the most unforgettable one, as no other hotels could provide the same level of luxurious stay as well as impeccable service with such a personal touch at the same time.

Lovely Hazel from Guest Relations took really good care of us from check-in to check-out. We felt so pampered by her hospitality. I appreciate all the detailed thoughts she had put in to prepare the amenities in our room. It certainly made the difference and meant a lot to us!

In fact, when we were in Macau, many friends and relatives advised us to cut short of our trip and stay away from Hong Kong in such an eventful time, but we still decided to proceed as I had a lot of faith in the Peninsula. Now I'm so glad that we made the right decision because it's worth all the effort.

You can place a price tag on a trip, but a beautiful memory like this is priceless. We simply can't wait to go back to the Peninsula Hong Kong again."
209,Date of stay: June 2019,40,Nice location,"Nice location. It was Accessible to Bus, MTR & Ferries and near to some tourist spots. A bit pricey but worth the price.However there are some staff still cannot understand and speak english. We enjoyed our stay."
210,Date of stay: August 2019,50,Out of expected,"I have not stayed in The Peninsula Hotel after it has been renovated .
The rooms are very Peninsula theme, well maintained even at the main tower .

I do consider this as one of the best hotels compared to other big brands or those which I have stayed before .. one of the best !

And to ace the list , their breakfast options are definitely better than other Peninsula outlets and most of the 5 stars hotels .

Japanese food is good . Pretty authentic . It’s a pity that I didn’t have extra nights to explore the rest of the eateries in the hotel ."
211,Date of stay: July 2019,50,The Man with the Golden Gun,"Immaculate service. Everything was on point , the correspondences, transfers, check in and out, room amenities, attention to details and spectacular views. Would love to go back again! Highly recommended!"
212,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Grande Dame lived up to expectations,"We stayed for four nights during the Easter holidays with two parents, a child and grandma in two rooms. It was my first time staying at a Peninsula property and it lived up to the hype. The property is beautiful and historic, but the rooms are upgraded to a modern standard. Nail polish hand drier!! Its a great base for exploring Hong Kong - even though its not on the ""city"" side. That just means you can experience the wonderful light show from your comfortable hotel."
213,Date of stay: July 2019,50,Afternoon Tea.,"This was a treat for my wife and we really enjoyed the whole experience from the sumptious surroundings in the lobbey to the attentive staff. The array of food on offer from sweet to savoury was excellent too. There was no hurry with my wife's tea topped up om a regular basis, and my coffee replenished as I needed it. Great experience in great surroundings"
214,Date of stay: March 2019,50,THE place to stay in Hong Kong,The service is what make this place special to our family. We return year after year because the service is exceptional and refined. Also the location is hard to beat. We can't imagine staying elsewhere.
215,Date of stay: July 2019,50,Outstanding!,"Outstanding. The quality of this hotel truly deserves its reputation. Not only are rooms and facilities in a league of its own, but the real experience comes from the service. The room is constantly being looked after and set up to match the time of the day. Charging cables being wrapped, books being set up with bookmarks, minibar set up with new ice, the bathroom prepared with candles and bath salts etc. The room was well labeled and organized with all you need."
216,Date of stay: June 2019,50,Does it Get Much Better Than This?,"Staying at a Peninsula hotel has long been on my bucket list, so you can imagine how excited I was when I found out that I would be staying with my tour group at three of them during our tour throughout China (Hong Kong, Beijing, Shanghai). This was the first Peninsula hotel I stayed in and by far the one I liked the most. The level of service and attention to detail was phenomenal and I was always greeted with a smile. The afternoon tea was fabulous and I was glad that I didn't have to queue for the tea as a hotel guest, just make a reservation. My spa treatment was divine and the view of the harbor from the relaxation room was a real treat. The service I received at this hotel has definitely spoiled me. Oh well, I guess I'll have to find more Peninsula's to stay in."
217,Date of stay: July 2019,50,Every bit the iconic hotel I hoped for...,"We are traveling in Asia for five weeks with our four children and staying at all of the Peninsulas along the way. This hotel is the best of all of them.

The bright spots are a massive pool, friendly and attentive staff, amazing arcade of shops, wonderful lobby atmosphere, great rooftop bar with a view across the river. The rooms are large and have the classic wood finishing that appears elsewhere, such as Paris.

Everyone speaks English, so there is no language barrier. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else."
218,Date of stay: August 2018,40,"Great stay, too popular and crowded","We stayed for 3 nights at the Pen before heading to Angkor. We decided to splurge and booked the VIP arrival package and were picked up at the gate after disembarking the plane, whisked through immigration, and were brought to the Rolls Royce Phantom car for the transfer to the hotel: Very nice albeit very expensive experience. We booked a deluxe room in the main wing and were upgrade to the tower with a room facing Kowloon which was very spacious but lacked character. In hindsight we should have upgraded to a harbor view to make the stay more memorable. What we liked very much: pool area with the big terrace overlooking HK and very nice staff, location is terrific and you can walk to the star ferry to get to HK Island easily. What we think could be improved: (1) breakfast: we had to wait for a table almost every day at the Verandah (buffet style breakfast), they were too busy. On the day of check-out, we decided to have a la carte breakfast at the Lobby. Our waitress was totally overwhelmed, drinks arrived late. They forgot about my mother‘s breakfast and we ran late. (2) Also, the hotel has no space in the Lobby for its guests to sit. The Lobby tends to get very crowded with tourists and visitors for the afternoon tea and you really have to fight your way through the reception. However, when we were waiting to get picked up for the airport transfer, we were a bit lost since there is nowhere for hotel guests to sit but for one sofa at the reception. Further, we found the front desk staff a bit disappointing as they did not always greet or say anything nice when you passed by but would often look down or pretend to be busy. I always wanted to stay at the Pen in HK. I must say that I enjoyed my stay very much, but would probably opt for another hotel next time which is not so busy and famous as the Pen."
219,Date of stay: July 2019,50,Exquisite...treated like ROYALTY❤️,"The founding principles of the Peninsula Brand were...exceed every expectation of every guest every time they visit! Create an experience that even ROYALS will marvel! Build gorgeous hotels with extravagant decor in chic locations that serve the finest food and provide service that is sure to thrill each guest as if they are ROYAL... even the ROYALS are smiling! When you arrive, you know you are in the finest hotel and a wave of emotions comes over you... your in for an experience of a lifetime! From the Rolls Royce house cars picking you up at the airport if you wish... to the staff greetings upon arrival and the daily graciousness and attentiveness to your every need! My experience was amazing as usual with an added story that so impressed me❤️ I wasn’t feeling well the next morning and hotel managers sent security and a nurse within minutes of my call to my room! They were amazing, thoughtful and caring! They checked on me all day. The following morning, I still wasn’t feeling great so they called a local VIP Dr close by and got me in for the 1st appt of the day... then they had provided a personal security guard to walk me over to the drs office and stay with me the whole time...he even asked if he should come in for the exam :), I smiled and said I’ll be ok! That’s the Peninsula and I absolutely love the hotel and staff❤️"
220,Date of stay: July 2018,50,Afternoon tea to line up for,"Lovely and delicious, but anticipate a line so come early.

It was my first time but my siblings have been there and so knew what to get thus everything I had was good. The scones with clotted cream are unforgettable, I had to write a review now since I recently had scones in another restaurant and this was a far cry and wish that these scones can easily be available where I live.

Will definitely line up again for afternoon tea the next time we're in HK."
221,Date of stay: May 2019,50,AMAZING !!!,"This was our first stop on a tour of China! What a start! This hotel is Amazing! World Class service! The suites are spacious, neat and beyond clean! Great location for shopping and enjoying the harbor area."
222,Date of stay: May 2019,50,First Class in Every Way!,Great experience at the Peninsula flagship. Rooms were impeccable - clean and modern. Great harbor views from rooms on upper floors. Nice indoor pool. Spa was top notch - great service. Enjoyed every aspect of this grand dame - highly recommended!
223,Date of stay: June 2019,50,World class service in iconic hotel,"I recently stayed at the Peninsula for two nights on my way back to the UK from Australia. Throughout my stay I experienced superb service where nothing was too much to ask and anything I requested was quickly supplied or responded to. My harbour view room offered state of the art technology, space and comfort. However the showstopper is the spectacular view of Hong Kong island - what a site to wake up to! I would like to make special mention of the service I received after I checked-out as I had a couple of hours to pass before my journey to the airport. Not only was I given complementary coffee (and cheesecake!) but I also received a small gift and was given access to the hotel's small museum. I was sorry to leave and will certainly return next time I am in Hong Kong. Special thanks to Hazel Tang, Guest relations Executive for all of her help."
224,Date of stay: June 2019,50,3rd Peninsula in 3 weeks!,"Our favorite hotels have to be The Peninsulas, and this one did not disappoint! We were checked in by Hazel Tang and from the moment she gave us our upgraded suite she took care of us like royalty. We told her it was our 40th Anniversary and she sent us a big bouquet of roses and peonies( she had asked me what my favorite flowers were when we talked about visiting the flower market. She bought us drinks and wine. She made sure we were taken care of in all the restaurants and bars. Our tables were always by the window so we could see the lite shows of Hong Kong at night.
Our room had a fireplace and telescope and all phone calls to the states were easily made from the room landline for free. The hotel like all the Peninsulas are magnificent. The service impeccable......even the housekeeping services lined up all our toiletries and folded our clothes!
The location was on The Kowloon side and perfectly, which is where vacationers should stay. The business trip people are better off on the Hong Kong side"
225,Date of stay: May 2019,50,Still the favorite in Hong Kong,"Having stayed at several Hong Kong luxury hotels, the Peninsula is still our favorite. Just completed a three night stay there for business and pleasure. Minor issues at check-in as it was booked on line through FHR AMX. Hotel did not understand that expedia is just the booking engine and that this was an FHR reservation. So no mention of amenities, no survey, no room upgrade to harbor view although the hotel was not full. However, once discussed with the team, the breakfast credit and additional credit for the hotel was extended. Room was very well appointed and clean. Appreciated the small touches like replacing the fruit that was missing each day. Dined in the Swiss restaurant as the other was closed for a private event. Had dim sum in Chinese restaurant and it was excellent. The host quickly found a table on a Saturday afternoon even though I hadn't made a reservation. Definitely superior hotel to others in the city although there are many nice ones."
226,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Perfectly spoiled,"Arrived in one of the hotel’s Rolls Royce limousines. Greeted at the limo by the front desk manager who apologized that our room was not yet available (9AM) and brought us to another room in the classic portion of the hotel to use as we waited until our room on a top floor of the tower was ready. The classic Room was top notch. Our tower Room offered a wonderful view of HK harbor and all its activity.
High Tea in the gorgeous lobby was very traditional and a cool place for people watching. A special treat was having lunch and relaxing for a few hours by the pool.
A bucket list item for me!"
227,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Out of the past,Wonderful old fashioned hotel that has survived all the latest trends and where service is valued. Senior staff a little self opinionated but polite. Clean and well managed a great experience before reverting to one of the mainstream for your next visit
228,Date of stay: May 2019,40,the legendary Peninsula,"It is arguably the best Hotel in town . I do not know Hong Kong much so I cannot judge. The room is super well appointed with lots of things I had never seen anywhere else - the make up table with the mirror that rises and illuminates at the touch of a button, the nail drier etc, etc. Also the bathroom is very well thought of and comfortable. We had a room at the back so I cannot comment on the harbour view , our view was quite ugly. The afternoon tea is nothing special to tell you the truth , I had better. The little sweets were all too sweet even though the scones were good and the sandwich ... hmmm I don't remember anything about them. It is pleasant that during the tea there is live music and very pleasant one and yes the cars parked outside are quite impressive."
229,Date of stay: May 2019,40,Unique level of personal service,"We stayed for two nights at the Peninsula Hotel. We had not suspected that there were so many clever ways to make a hotel room convenient: vanity mirror that rises out of the table, electrical sockets that rise out of the desktop, a tray for drinks that slides out of the sofa armrest, everything operated by a control pad from your bedside. The automatic shade kept the light out of the room in the mornings.

We signed up for the high tea in the lobby the next afternoon mainly because it was in such high demand and guests could make a reservation. Most reviewers loved the cakes and candies but they were too full of cream for us. Visually, they were hand-made masterpieces with bits of ultra-thin gold and silver making them pleasing to the eye. The orchestra played Rogers and Hammerstein and Burt Bacharach songs.

All of the staff, from welcomers to front desk to housekeeping, were highly professional and well trained. Cleaning every day was more than thorough.
This was our first stay at the Peninsula, and for us, it was very good."
230,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Exceptional,"A Harbor view room is the one to choose. Spectacular view. A stay there is worth the price. The facility was upgraded, so it now has all the electronic bells and whistles starting with the elevator/room-door entry/and every room interior ""switch"". The hotel has a choice of restaurants, all very good. The hotel is noted for it daily ""High Tea"". As a guest at the hotel, you won't have to wait in the always long line for your table.The hotel arcade offers a choice of shops."
231,Date of stay: May 2019,40,Everyone Here Is A VIP !!,"The Most prestigious Hotel to visit in Hong Kong mainly because of it's History & Tradition.
The welcome is Nice, The Front Desk team tell you every guest at The Peninsula is a VIP. Makes you feel good. As we entered we were extremely happy to learn the flowers here were of a high quality but more importantly REAL unlike everywhere else in Hong Kong.
Our room on floor 21 had an excellent view of Victoria Harbour. My reason for 4 stars is
Breakfast for 3 days of our stay was identical It was like Deja Vu every morning at breakfast.
The toilets have no health faucets. That is almost unacceptable since it is Hong Kong's best.
There is a signage about dress code at the Tea Lounge. To me that is like saying ...
Please don't relax on your holiday. Follow rules & be Prim & Proper. That kinda sucks.
As wonderful that their prim & proper service is.
We felt if tips are needed in the art of Hospitality The Peninsula Team or whosoever is in charge of the team needs to visit India once & observe how guests are actually pampered in almost every Hotel be it small or big.
Merely saying everyone is a VIP does not suffice. To make everyone feel special & important needs to be there.
Respect has to be given to every guest entering The Peninsula whether they drive in a ferrari or a plain Taxi. All are equal not just the ones who have a room inside. A tip should not buy respect.
A Guest in India is like God ... No matter who.
Everyone is doing their job very well, I am certain but it has to be done from the heart & not just from the head.
It is sad that we got a Nice Welcome but not as warm as is Needed."
232,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Very pleasant stay. Lovely view and what a lively lobby,"Stayed here once again. Love it. The best of Hong Kong. Five star with shiny golden stars. They have a fleet of rolls royces outside, but the real rolls Royce is this hotel itself. Amazing rooms with amazing harbor view, friendly concierge and very impressive views from the Felix lounge. Love this hotel in Hong Kong."
233,Date of stay: May 2019,50,Perfection amidst tradition and modernity,"Spent 2 nights at this legendary hotel and finally understood why people rave about it, and how it justifies its high prices. Yes, it is expensive, but I felt that it actually offered good value, in terms of the attention to detail in every aspect, and the excellent service.

I opted for a room in the main building, which is the historic building built in 1928 (according to the Hotel Channel which plays on the TV!), as I wanted a more ""authentic"" experience. These rooms occupy floors 3-6 of the Main Building, whilst the ""Tower"" rooms are on floors 17 - 27, with offices occupying the intermediate space. My room, 533, although of an entry-level ""Deluxe"" category, was exceptionally spacious, with a large entrance hall lined with drawers, closets and a spacious luggage bench. A pair of carved double doors opened to the bedroom, which featured a very comfortable king-size bed, a double sofa, writing desk, make-up desk and chair (with a purpose-built makeup mirror which glided electronically out from a recess) and a dining table with 2 chairs. The high ceilings amplified the space, with 2 large windows overlooking the famous Peninsula courtyard, fountain and the driveway parked with the hotel's signature green Rolls-Royce fleet.

I had anticipated some level of snootiness from the staff, but I was proven completely wrong. At every interaction, every staff member, young or old, was very friendly and polite, and I felt so welcome despite my casual attire.

The hotel was renovated several years ago, yet in my room on the 5th floor, everything looked brand-new, with not a single scratch or dent on any surface. The lighting, audio-visual equipment and curtains were operated via 2 iPad-style tablets (one each on the bedside and writing desk).

I slept soundly as the room seemed to be sound-proofed, while the curtains provided a total black-out experience, save for a sliver of light from under the bathroom door (there is a frosted window in the bathroom which does not have a curtain or covering). Wi-fi was fast, reliable and free.

Whilst the lobby was often busy, the corridors of my floor were consistently deserted, which made for a very private and exclusive atmosphere. I never even saw a single housekeeper's trolley.

Sadly, due to commitments with friends, I did not have the opportunity to sample any of the food and beverage outlets, although I did enjoy swimming every morning in the large 20-metre long pool, which was very well heated (some might say over-heated, especially if, like me, you swim multiple laps for exercise), with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the famous Hong Kong harbour and island skyline.

The lobby was simply stunning, with gilded ceilings, an orchestra which serenaded guests every afternoon tea and evening, surrounded by the glittering displays of the adjacent jewellery boutiques. Noticeably, there was a long queue for the famous Peninsula afternoon tea every day, and this was a slightly jarring note in an otherwise beautiful and elegant space.

As the Peninsula is situated in the heart of the very hectic Tsim Sha Tsui commercial precinct, it was always a pleasure to step out of that bustle into the hushed and cool surrounds of the hotel. Directly opposite the rear entrance of the hotel is the Tsim Sha Tsui subway station. The hotel's Rolls-Royce airport transfer service costs HKD 1,800 per trip - not cheap, but considering that it is a circa-45 minute drive in such an expensive and luxurious vehicle, it is something which I will consider for my next visit, as well as perhaps a room in the considerably more expensive Tower.

I came away from my visit feeling thoroughly pampered and relaxed, and cannot recommend this stunning property enough."
234,Date of stay: April 2019,50,SPECTACULAR. ICONIC!,"The Peninsula Kowloon, is one of the most iconic hotels of its kind in the world.

Beautiful location across the promenade, glitzy and glam setting, enchanting ambiance, British flair with a Hong Kong touch. What’s not to love?

Centrally located on Tsim Tsa Tsui and right across the HK Space Museum, you have to try The Peninsula’s afternoon tea. Prices are high as any fancy place in HK but it’s an experience you’ll cherish forever. You’re looking at $100 USD per person.

Have coffee in their lobby if you don’t want to spend a hundred dollars. Enjoy the classy yet wondrous interior, the splendid decor, opulent chandeliers and spacious seating areas.

Free hotel Wifi for all hotel visitors or guests.

You won’t be disappointed."
235,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Very comfortable hotel,"This hotel includes several restaurants, a nice fitness center, spa, and is located in the heart of the hustle and bustle of the city. Upon check in, we were escorted to our room and shown the various features of the space (everything is controlled wirelessly with pads that are strategically located). Our reservation came with breakfast which was a nice buffet. Shopping malls, McDonalds, Pizza Hut, as well as various Chinese and Korean restaurants are nearby. Be prepared for the crowded sidewalks. This hotel is a nice respite from the busy outdoor experience. You will feel appreciated as a guest if you stay at this hotel."
236,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Simply superb,"There really is nothing to fault with this hotel. The Rolls Royce car service is well worth the money and whisks you from the aircraft all the way through the airport to your car. The amazing team at the hotel are all ready and waiting for your arrival and check in is a non event.

The room is wonderful. Impeccably furnished and decorated, capturing the essence of Hong Kong and with every amenity you could wish for. The bathrooms are similarly opulent with a separate shower and tub, and a dressing area with wonderful toiletries.

The view is stunning, right across the harbour to Hong Kong island, although admittedly not all of the rooms can offer this view.

We used the spa. Again, one of the best I’ve experienced with a wonderful pool overlooking the harbour, and numerous hot and cold plunge pools, a steam room and sauna.

As is often the case with hotels of this standard, the its the team that really make the difference. It’s a spectacular hotel with wonderful amenities but the level of training and service is exemplary, and it showed with every single member of the team with whom I had the pleasure to interact.

The only proble is, I simply won’t stay anywhere else on all my future trips to Hong Kong!"
237,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Highlight . again and again,"The Pen is THE hotel in Hongkong and I was simply excited to stay there again. The rooms are newly refurbished and cosy, modern, functional and luxurious. I liked the view to the harbour very much and I personally think it is worth the extra price.

Food is delicious, staff very attentative and helpful, the pool breathtaking."
238,Date of stay: March 2019,50,One of the most luxurious hotels in the world,"It's all been said before, but I'll add my comments as well...If you can afford to splurge to stay here, it's an absolutely amazing property. Over the top luxury and a small army of cheerful helpful staff.

We had an airport transfer, so a Rolls Royce drove us, which was fun. On arrival, they skipped checkin at the front desk and took us directly to our amazing room, where they did the checkin process there.

If you want one of the most amazing hotel rooms in the world, pay extra for a suite with views on three sides on an upper floor. You get a wall of windows looking out over Hong Kong bay on the front of the room. The side of the room looks out over another part of the bay, and the back of the room/bathroom looks out over Kowloon. It's such an amazing view day and night that you won't want to leave the room. It's great to just sit there and soak in the view.

The room even has a little shoe closet where you can leave your shoes to be polished overnight for no charge. When you're walking and traveling a lot, that's a nice benefit.

The lobby is immense and gorgeous. Our room was luxurious and comfortable. The AC was super cold, which is appreciated when it's so hot and humid outside. Room darkening shades, so blissfully dark and quiet at night. The bathroom was gorgeous, with a soaking tub set up to enjoy the city views.

Breakfast was great. Huge selection of top quality items.

The Star Ferry is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel, so super convenient to cross over to Hong Kong.

The only downside to this hotel is it's expensive, but you really feel that you get what you pay for here. I look for excuses to go to Hong Kong just to stay here."
239,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Deservedly Grand Dame,"Pampered from the time we arrive. Great guest recognition, addressed by name wherever we went. Intuitive room controls from Ipad type control. Super strong water pressure for a shower, very refreshing.
Tradition and experience speaks for itself. 30 years gap since we enjoyed the must-do Afternoon tea in the lobby lounge, did not disappoint.
Staff service impeccable, attentive and very experienced. I casually glanced at one of the wait staff, he immediately knew what I wanted.
Short but lovely stay. This is one of those places that you wished you stayed a few days more and really take in the classic old school glam, which is rare these days."
240,Date of stay: February 2019,50,Very enjoyable end to a holiday,"Stayed here in the way back from Australia to the U.K., when stopping over for a few days to break the journey. An experience for sure, and a good location. Impeccable service, though the lobby gets very busy with the afternoon tea service!

Staff attentive but not intrusive, and room immaculate - our suite didn’t have a particularly special view, but was large, comfortable and well equipped.

The Rolls Royce transfer to the airport was a last minute end of holiday extravagance, but actually not *that* expensive. Would definitely stay here again!"
241,Date of stay: October 2018,50,Amazing hotel,"Ask the hotel to pick you up at the gate of your airplane and to take you all the way to your Rolls Royce…back to the hotel! check-in your harbor view suite and have a Chinese breakfast with Dim-Sum etc…amazing. Spring Moon restaurant is very good as well as the Japanese restaurant ""Imasa"". You need to make a tour in their ""mini"" clubman with driver, it's a great way to discover Hong Long and then finish you day at the Spa..."
242,Date of stay: April 2019,10,Asia April 2019,"After staying in 5 hotels on a 15 day business trip to SE Asia, The Peninsula was the most expensive (by 100%!) and least desirable experience. The lobby was having a sewer issue and constantly smelled, when questioning the staff they kind of laughed and said this is what happens with an old building! Staff at the restaurants and bars was not friendly to the point you didn't want to use. The Davidoff Cigar store / lounge might have been the worst. Bellmen were very good and the rooms were nice."
243,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Great gym for free weights and exercising,"Much is written of the Peninsula Hotel rooms, food, beverages, service and arcade shopping so I have chosen to introduce the gym to readers fortunate to stay at this grand, premier Asian hotel.

The photos show the broad range of equipment available for guests from free weights, machines for legs, back and upper body together with running, rowing and bike exercise machines.

Hot and cold plunge pools, steam rooms and sauna are located in the locker/changing rooms.

Children from the age of 12 years with 24 hour availability.

A short walk up a flight of steps from the gym is an 18m swimming pool on the 8th floor, with opening hours 6am to 9.30pm and great views of Hong Kong harbour, a great place to relax with family."
244,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Afternoon tea excellence!,"Over the years, popped into the Penninsula for Afternoon Tea when visiting Hong Kong. This year, I went with two friends, one of whom had never been. Always arrive around 1.30pm so near or at front of queue for seating from 2pm. Airy and spacious, pleasant music but the main event was the afternoon tea itself. Savouries and sandwiches tasty and fresh, scones warm with good amount if cream and jam; tea with regular hot water refills. Always a struggle to finish (in our case) the small cake and biscuit selection so you can ask to take away.
It's your meal for the day so wisdom says go easy on your breakfast. An experience all ages enjoy - previous visits have delighted my 3 children and my wife."
245,Date of stay: April 2019,50,Always love Peninsula HK,"I came back to Peninsula HK again. This is very fast trip for me, I decided to went to HK around 10 Apr and book the hotel the next day.

The reservation team has a good information for me.

I arrived HK and went to Peninsula HK with signature Rolls Royce pick up which is very perfect transfer.

I requested the room that I used to stay before (2313) and the staffs also provided me that room. I really appreciated that because it means a lot to me more than you can imagine. I really want to say millions of Thanks for you.

Bryan, the staff who escorted me to the room did his job very best, I really want to give him many thanks too.

The room is still perfect for me, the view, the bed, the amenity and everything are all perfect.

I have a chance to have dinner at Chesa and lunch at Spring Moon. They are really great. The staffs, the service and the food are really fabulous.

I got complimentary late check out which really surprised me.

Summarizingly, Peninsula HK is still the best hotel for me in HK.
I love love love this hotel :)"
246,Date of stay: March 2019,50,The only place I'll stay in Hong Kong!,"Another wonderful experience. Always attentive to detail. As I arrived on at an unpleasantly early hour (6 am) after a long flight, the staff had thoughtfully arranged a light breakfast in my room (guessing I probably didn't want to head downstairs and would rather relax in place). What other hotels think about the needs of their guests like this? True luxury is having your needs taken care of before you even think to ask.

Rooms are wonderfully appointed and everything works well. The views are unbeatable.

Went to visit a friend at the new Rosewood to see if I was missing anything. I certainly wasn't. Overdesigned and unorganized.

I'll happily keep staying at the Peninsula, thank you."
247,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Nice to reunite,"Service, Class, Refinement.
These are what you come to the Peninsula Hong Kong for. For four generations our family has been staying in this iconic place which should be a world heritage site for setting the standard in hotel service. While the lobby and other outlets are indeed noteworthy, one has to look beyond these and focus into the deeper core values and institutional tenets which a guest can feel when staying here. These values, class, service, refinement, space, attention to detail... were distilled from a long span of excellent hotel experience. It was nice to see Mr. and Mrs. Bieger. They are excellent Ambassadors of the Peninsula name. While times do call for change, the values mentioned have endured the test of time and should never be tampered with. My congratulations."
248,Date of stay: March 2019,50,"Wonderful hotel, highly recommended","I stayed here for 2 nights whilst visiting Hong Kong with friends. The visit was spectacular. The room was luxurious and very well laid out. The bed was very comfortable and I didn’t want to leave it! Some lovely touches included a wireless phone charging pad by the bed and different levels of mood lighting. The turn down service was spot on and all the staff were super helpful and lovely. We did have food there one evening, which was expensive but that’s to be expected. I’d definitely recommend this hotel experience."
249,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Wow!,"We stayed at the peninsula for three nights prior to departing Hong Kong on a cruise. We arrived in the evening following a 24 hour two Legg trip to Hong Kong from Austin. We were met at baggage claim by a peninsula representative and escorted to the curb where a beautiful Rolls Royce was waiting. After a 25 minute ride to Kowloon we were met in the lobby and escorted to our corner Harbor Front suite. We completed check in sitting in our living room and looking out over Victoria Harbour which was lit up much of the time with the nightly light show from the buildings across the harbor. Absolutely everything from that point on was perfect. Our suite was decadent with a 180° view. We had breakfast one morning downstairs in the elegant dining room that would later in the afternoon be jammed with people waiting for afternoon tea. Breakfast though was quiet and intimate, served from a menu. We also enjoyed breakfast on the rooftop dining area where a massive international buffet was available. This was a glamorous albeit expensive first stop in Asia and a perfect place from which to explore Kowloon, Victoria Harbour, and launch a tour of Hong Kong city across the harbor."
250,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Complete Perfection from Start to Finish,"This was my 10th visit to the Peninsula, Hong Kong. I came here to celebrate my 50th birthday. People often ask me why I continue to return to Hong Kong ? time and again..The reason I love returning to Hong Kong is because I continue to return to the most wonderful hotel on the planet. I am not exaggerating
when I say that the Peninsula in Hong Kong is PERFECT in every way, The way the concierge staff, management of rooms, spa and other teams work together to make sure your arrival and departure are flawless is truly amazing. There is never any error or chance of any detail left unmanaged. Before I arrive, I make my room request and Mateo Gonzalez who has been working at the Peninsula as long as I started coming here always does his best to execute my desired room if it is available ..I have a favorite room for some reason its like coming home to a room I am familiar with. I enjoy the tower rooms as well as rooms in the original building.
Anyway, its always nice to have my request met and I am happy no matter what. the concierge team make sure that I am handled before and during my stay and I really appreciate all their efforts to make sure I am on track to be where I need to be and give me informed details to help me enjoy my trip more. The staff in the spa including Sumie, Genevieve and Winnie are so welcoming and loving and professional and time after time continue to impress me with their acts of kindness

The beautiful pool and lovely facilities are the cleanest , shiniest and most luxurious I have ever known. Everything sparkles from top to bottom at the Peninsula in Hong Kong from the floors to the people.

The amenities of the hotel from the pool, to the shops and the dining and the spa are so wonderful you almost don't want to walk outside, When I go out for my daily activities it is always the best part to return to the hotel and smell the fragrance of the lobby and surroundings.

To the guest relations team including Hazel and Marble and Henry and the director of guest relations, thank you so much for being spectacular in every way and making me feel special The care and kindness that is extended to the guests is so top notch its impossible to find pleasure in other travels to compare to the efforts made here in Hong Kong.

Al the way from the house keeping staff to the hotel manager Mr. Oba, thank you so much for being the best at what you do and making the Peninsula in Hong Kong one of the best travel experiences I have had time after time. I will always return and always be grateful to the perfection you extend to your guests. The attention to detail and the professionalism is unbelievable.

To anyone considering a trip to Hong Kong. Splurge on The Peninsula, it will make your experience in Hong Kong more enjoyable and more memorable. No other hotel in the world has impressed me as much as the PEN HK"
251,Date of stay: January 2019,40,Amazing Experience!,"It was a great experience to stay in the Peninsula Hong Kong. Very professional hospitality and the rooms are beautiful, the decoration feel special.

The beds are very pleasant and the rooms are very clean.

Located at the Victoria Harbour with its Laser Light Show, and right next to Tsim Sha Tsui's famous shopping Arcade, the Peninsula is perfectly located."
252,Date of stay: March 2019,50,Phil Australia 🇦🇺,Have been to hong kong many times over the years always gone past the peninsula and said i must stay here but or for one thing or another never got around to it. Well am i glad i did this time wow 😲 if your looking for class this place is it i booked a harbour view and was upgraded to a harbour view suite amazing views all along the hong kong harbour. The spa is a must high tea is another i went all the way and had the rolls Royce airport transfers !!! The hotel has so many good restaurants 😋😋😋 by no means is it cheap but you get what you pay for. Its a big yes from me 👍🏻
253,Date of stay: February 2019,50,Made our stay special,"This was not coming home to a place, this was coming back to a palace. The service and attention to detail of the staff members were professional not to mention the room service. Everything was running smoothly and we had to worry about nothing. Peninsula's atmosphere is very relaxed and comfortable, not noisy at all and good to enjoy some time after visiting the city, the rush hour was horrible but with the private transport we felt good. We'd come back again and highly recommend a stay here"
254,Date of stay: February 2019,50,"Excellent stay, pleased with just about everything. Wonderful end to a holiday","Enjoyed the hotel, the staff are excellent, the service superb and hotel facilities top notch.

Excellent breakfast, everything that anyone could possibly want.

Excellent location.

View from the Felix restaurant over the harbour, provided excellent view of the harbour and harbour light show.

Spa never crowded and with excellent facilities.

Excellent location,

One minor complaint, dealt with efficiently and quickly, to my complete satisfaction.

Afternoon tea, excellent,

Hotel Rolls Royce’s, a blast from the past,

Hotel room, both traditional but with all modern wireless WiFi facilities. Room a bit dark, so get a harbour view if available, but genuinely no complaints."
255,Date of stay: February 2019,50,thank you!! fantastic service,"I definitely come back to this hotel! such an amazing stay! thanks to everyone from arrival to departure, One of the best hotels in the world, nice view, and I really like the location and all the local from HK is very hospitable"
256,Date of stay: January 2019,50,I wanted to vote 6 stars!,"Some hotels standout to the point that you should be able to separate them from other excellent hotels! If you reserved 5 stars for only the very best, then many other hotels would have to be graded 4 in comparison, which wouldn’t be fair on them. The Peninsula is a truly outstanding hotel. It is difficult to fault in any way. The room was fantastic. I could control practically everything from the tablet. Extremely well thought out design wise. This is so often missed by hotels where the layout could be so much better. The spa/poll area magnificent. The lobby and afternoon tea, simply excellent. The location, the amenities, the food offering, all are excellent +. I could move in! If you want to end your stay in style, book one of the famous green Rolls Royce’s to take you to the airport, where a hotel representative greets you and assists with your check in! One of the very best hotels I’ve stayed in ever."
257,Date of stay: February 2019,50,Luxury Unlimited,One of the best hotels in the world. Grand lobby - very well maintained and decorated. Check in very efficient and personalized. Staff courteous friendly helpful. Elevators clean well maintained convenient. Rooms large well provided stocked with grand Harbour view or reasonably good city view. Bathrooms large very clean with toiletteries from Oscar de la Renta marvelous. Cookies chocolates fruits and Coffee Tea in the room. Well stocked mini bar. Very large beds with memory efficient mattresses and pillows. Luggage delivered to room within minutes of arrival. Large pool and an outside deck with grand Harbour view. Spa Sauna Gym luxurious. A very high end shopping arcade. Multiple dining choices - loved Spring Moon the Chinese restaurant - great food - Beijing Duck superb - choice of wines and courteous service. Breakfast at Verandah - all old world charm very large varied choice - large slow moving ceiling fans make the place look grand. Check out efficient very helpful Concierge service. Just one discordant note - during very popular High Tea the Lobby becomes a bit too crowded. And if you are staying in one of the Grand suites you get to use a Rolls the ultimate luxury. The hotel is one of the most expensive in Hong Kong and is money well spent.
258,Date of stay: July 2018,50,The Gold Standard,"I have stayed at the Peninsula 5 times now. It's my gold standard hotel and the hotel I grade all hotels by across the globe. Each time I get a deluxe harbour view room and each time I take a deep breath when I see the skyline. The service from the airport forward is amazing. I usually get the Rolls pick up service which picks you up as you get off the airplane and shuttles you to immigration and then whisks you into a green Rolls. From the moment they pick you up to the moment you leave I'm not sure you could stump the staff with desires at the Peninsula. The service is just outstanding. I love it so much I took my father here a decade ago before he died. In his career he had visited 83 countries and stayed at thousands of hotels across the globe. After a day at the Peninsula he looked at me and said ""This is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed at in my life"". And that's how I feel across the board. The food is impeccable, the bar is fantastic, the pool, just wow. Best pool view in a city ever. If you are on your way to Hong Kong and want to have the full experience this is the place to stay. I will be back again, and again to the amazing hotel."
259,Date of stay: February 2019,50,"Love, Love the Peninsula Brand","This was our second visit to Hong Kong and the Peninsula and we were not disappointed. From our transfer at the cruise terminal to arrival in our suite that was available at 10:00 a.m. we knew we would enjoy this 3 night stay.
Our suite was large and well appointed. So beautifully hi-tech with even a phone to call anywhere in the world at no extra charge. Housekeeping maintained the suite within minutes of us leaving for breakfast.
The breakfast buffet was outstanding with both Asian and Western offerings.
The Bar is a small bar room with a great piano player/singer Jimmy. We enjoyed cocktails with nice bar staff, before dinner every night listening to the talented Jimmy.
The Peninsula brand never disappoints. If traveling to Hong Kong it's the only place to stay."
260,Date of stay: January 2019,50,An absolutely wonderful hotel. The best of everything. The most high Tech bedroom we have ever had.,"Staff and facilities A1. The hotel boasts a fleet of 14 Rolls Royce Phantom cars, painted in the hotels colours. The location couldn't be better. Easy walk to get a ferry. Restaurants first class but you need to book. The Chinese and Japanese restaurants are wonderful."
261,Date of stay: February 2019,50,Best hotel in the world,"Stayed there many times very nice!!!!
World class excellent service great experience strongly recommend.
Looking forward for more stays in the future children loved it.
Had a pick up and drop to and from the airport no other hotels have such service"
262,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Exactly What I Needed,"This was my first ever solo trip overseas. So I decided to choose a city I had visited several times with my husband and that I felt relatively comfortable in. Then a hotel, well if you have been lucky enough to stay at the Peninsula once you really do look forward to a return visit. I booked a suite and it was wonderful. Every member of staff that I spoke to about anything was interested in helping with whatever I had asked about. The room service people, the maid, the turndown service, reception, concierge, everyone was polite and impeccably well mannered. The rooms were amazing the carpet, the decorations, the fruit bowl, the bed! It was a gadget lovers paradise, curtains lighting, temperature control all automated on iPads as well as pads on the walls. Don't bother taking an adaptor, each bedside table has a charging station.
The mini driver that took me to the Jade Markets was very helpful. I had left my watch charger at home, which was not the smartest thing to do, so I asked if he knew where I could get a charger. Behind the hotel there was a Garmin shop, I got a new charger.
In my opinion there were no flaws in my time there, which was four nights. I was pleasantly pampered."
263,Date of stay: June 2018,50,Perfection,"Stunning. All aspects of this magnificent hotel are exquisite. From the moment I walked into the beautiful, historical building, entered the halls, rode the elevator up to our rooms, stepped into our suite, my breath was taken. Absolutely every detail, no matter how tiny, was executed flawlessly. The gourmet chocolates"
264,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Beautiful hotel,"The peninsula “the grand old dame” lives up to its reputation. Colonial elegance and excellent service sums it up. Room 501 on the 5th floor was tastefully appointed. Everything controlled by a tablet with perfect ease. The toiletries were high end and plentiful. The housekeeping staff were inconspicuous but efficient, our room had been made up by the time we had returned from breakfast.
Breakfast in the veranda restaurant was excellent and the Chinese breakfast that we took on one occasion in the lobby was also good.
The evening buffet in the Veranda was varied and enjoyable, but in line with Hong Kong prices for a high end establishment.
All in all an excellent stay in Hong Kong which I would wholeheartedly recommend.
Julie."
265,Date of stay: February 2018,30,"Classic, Predictable","I returned to the Peninsula after several years away from Hong Kong, which as China is less and less an inviting destination for a holiday, or for good shopping. But The Peninsula has been renovated and done extremely well - everything in the guest rooms is easily to locate and easy to use. Very well thought out! The art we noticed however was blah and trite, odd for such a lovely hotel. But the service was distinguished and refined as usual. I think the hotel could use a bit of color."
266,Date of stay: January 2019,50,The art of client service in Hong Kong,The Peninsula makes of client service more than exceeding or other marketing client retention tool. This hotel makes of client service.. Art! They look after their client with details and beyond the hotel doors..yes up to the airport arrival gate! If you can afford their top services you can get beyond any other hotel from helicopter / Rolls Royce transfer to in-room check-in. Must try their Michelin star Chinese restaurant Spring Moon and never skip the high end tea in the afternoon.
267,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Nothing Beats the Best,"Of all the hotels I've stayed while in Hong Kong, Peninsula Hong Kong was the best. Location, Room Size, and most especially the service was top notch. Upon check-in; each guests reservation has its own folder and all necessary needed information are all there. Check-in was fast. The rooms are huge and are new with one of the most technologically advance features that a hotel room can have. But what impressed me was their service. All staff were excellent.
If there's one thing on a negative side is that the Lobby has lots of people / tourist since this hotel is a iconic one in Hong Kong."
268,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Adorable Afternoon Tea,"Came here for afternoon tea in December before Christmas, and had a great time feeling like a kid again. The line starts around 1:15 - so get there early to line up - but once the seating starts, service is quick. The tea was incredible, and the mixed treats were great. Worth the experience!"
269,Date of stay: January 2019,40,Marvelous Architecture,Excellent service and very good location near Victoria Harbour and star ferry of HK with hop on- hop off buses starts just near Peninsula grand.Authentic Shenzen food is served here as Hong kong is very near to Shenzen of Mainland China.
270,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Afternoon Delight,"Visited this hotel to have ""high tea"" one afternoon whilst walking around Kowloon.
Beautiful spot with old colonial decor.
Had to wait in a queue for approx 40 mins to get a table , but it was worth it!
Once seated you were waited upon, with food & beverage options. Despite the demand on seating , were never rushed to leave."
271,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Premiere Hotel with exquisite Buffet,"There are many things to say about The Peninsula.
From the Rolls Royce that picks you up from the Airport, to the views of Hong Kong, it is one of the best that hotels have to offer.
The Pool & Terrace are great places to collect your thoughts.
The Buffet & Food options are top notch.
We were staying over the Christmas Holiday and found everything to be festive and warm. The Music in the Lobby was a great welcome home each time we entered the Hotel.
We had a great time with you on our way In and Out of mainland China to visit family in Chengdu. You made the trip as pleasant as could be. Thank you for everything."
272,Date of stay: January 2019,50,Stunning Hotel old world class and service,"What a delight it was to step into this wonderful hotel. So grand with its foyer and sweeping stair cases. The ambience is wonderful as is the food in their many food outlets. Afternoon Tea was a delight with fine teas and pastries.

The service was a joy. It was my dads 90th birthday and they really made him feel special."
273,Date of stay: January 2019,50,An unforgettable New Year's Eve countdown party in the Lobby,"My husband and I are big fans of the Peninsula hotel. It's the epitome of class and refined elegance. We would often go to the various venues in the establishment because their food and service are always first class ; and their live entertainment would always live up to the reputation of the grande dame hotel.

But to be honest,
we no longer go to the Lobby often for high tea because in recent years there is always a long queue for tables, it is a bit noisy and quite busy in the afternoon. Sorry, it is just not the same anymore.

We still love and would highly recommend their New Year's Eve gala dinner.
It's quite pricey but we think it is worth every penny, and this year it was no exception.
The food and service were of very high standard, considering the whole place was packed. And the cocktail before dinner was great.

From 7 pm to well past the countdown, the atmosphere was simply amazing, thanks in large part to the band which was very smooth ,versatile and simply so awesome.
The show just before the countdown was also outstanding.
What a wonderful way for everyone of us there to end the year on a high note and to welcome the new year.
The management must have spent a lot of time to make this party such a success. We're really appreciative of their effort and we can't wait to return for another memorable countdown party to welcome 2020."
274,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Perfect Holiday Stay...,"Spent four nights over Xmas and had the best time. The sign of a great hotel is not when everything goes smoothly, but how they fix the problems. After a small hiccup at check-in, Matteo the front desk manager provided a quick and kind fix. Very impressive. The rooms are first rate, modern and impeccable, and the staff, from the front desk to concierge to housekeeping are professional and so very helpful. During the holidays, the whole property is festive and decorated to the hilt. The location is perfect for Star Ferry and shopping at Harbor City. Will be coming back!"
275,Date of stay: December 2018,50,A Luxurious Stay~,"Stayed in a suite for one night and room move to a deluxe room for the second night. The suite is super spacious and comfy with harbour view. Especially in love with the bathroom for both room types. Love the design of white marble! Great services from operators and housekeepers. Pre-order room service (breakfast) the day before. Breakfast was sent up on time and tasted very good.
Forgot to ask for a foam pillow... The pillows in the room are way to soft.
Overall, the stay was wonderful and I would definitely return!!!"
276,Date of stay: July 2018,50,Love Love Love,"We have been fortunate to travel to many parts of the world, but the one hotel our kids say is their favorite is The Peninsula Hong. Not sure if it is the high tech rooms, watching the light show at night, the pool or indulging in the delicious milk shakes during Afternoon Tea with Mom and Dad - but The Peninsula is their favorite. The concierge is beyond helpful -- arranging day trips/transportation etc. Such a delight to stay there!"
277,Date of stay: December 2018,50,The Essence of Colonial HK,"Afternoon tea at the Peninsula is right up there with worldwide must-do’s. OK it’s a little pricey but if you can afford it then it’s well worth the time & energy.
It’s a tourist trap but also you see local business people trying to close deals mingling with the pasty faced tourists.
The tea & scones & finger food is spectacular & takes you right back to colonial Hong Kong, try and get a seat close to the string quartet plucking away in the central area. It’s a very pleasant couple of hours and strongly recommend even if it’s only to tick off the list."
278,Date of stay: December 2018,50,The Sanctuary,"Stayed for 5 nights in December.

Good:
Being able to check in early/check out late without feeling like you have to work for it was super. The staff at reception were lovely and not like they were going through the motions with the hundredth tourist that day.
The rooms were super quiet. You do not hear anything from other rooms or the corridor and it is delightful. I wish all high end hotels were like this.
The bed is super comfortable. An absolute delight.
The light system via the tablet was very easy and accessible from the bed. When the lights are off the room is super dark for those afternoon naps.
The shower was fabulous and is strong enough to create its own wind.
Housekeeping were excellent, and I like that there are no large carts left in the corridor. A small detail but in keeping with the luxury feel of the hotel.
Breakfast was delicious with a wide array of choices for guests.
The rooms are understated but have many little extras which make for such a comfortable stay; wireless charging stations, coffee machine, valet box and lovely stationery.

So-so: Afternoon tea in the Lobby was tasty, but the hotel is a tourist destination in itself and so the public areas are very, very busy.
The gym and pool were very well equipped. But there were just a couple of minor points. The cross trainers were quite corroded but otherwise the equipment was well maintained. Because there were no classes offered by the hotel they allow personal trainers to be used. Unfortunately, the times there was a trainer in with a guest, they tended to dominate several pieces of equipment at a time which is not accommodating to other users. It did not seem to be regulated at all by gym staff.
The hotel bathroom toiletries were incredibly over fragranced.

It was an outstanding stay in a very convenient location."
279,Date of stay: August 2018,50,First visit to Hong Kong,"It was our visit to Hong Kong and we stayed at the Peninsular for 5 nights.
It was spectacularly good. One of the great joys was going back to the calm tranquility of this beautiful hotel after the hustle bustle of the City. Afternoon tea was the highlight after the first day we were hooked. The room was fabulous, we had 3 meals in the hotel and they were all fantastic and the small bar at the top of the hotel with amazing views over Hong Kong was another highlight. It certainly wasn't cheap but staying there made the holiday."
280,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Old charm luxury at its best,"Stayed for 2 nights at this 10/10 luxury hotel in Hong Kong. From the minute you arrive with the Christmas lights and impressive interior decor, right to when you step into the rooms which are tastefully done. The concierge was very helpful and overall service top class. It may not be the most amazing location in Hong Kong in some opinions, but certainly offers an experience to remember."
281,Date of stay: December 2018,50,There’s nothing like a true Grande Dame,"My Wife and I and our two children just spent a wonderful three days at the Peninsular in Hong Kong. I have always wanted to stay there and my expectations were extremely high. We were fortunate enough to enjoy the green Rolls-Royce airport collection and return and everything from the moment we left the airport to the time that we returned was handled with class, sophistication, efficiency and style.

Coming from London we are used to extremely proficient city hotels but the Peninsular was, even by London standards, extremely opulent and impressive. The rooms had every convenience one would expect and were immaculately looked after and clean. The bathrooms were a little old-fashioned but also had everything anyone could possibly want and again were spotless.

The common areas hark back to a bygone era and are sumptious.

For me, the most impressive part of the hotel was the spa gym and swimming pool area. All Peninsular hotels seem to have particularly good gyms and Spas but this was the best of the lot. The swimming pool is absolutely amazing. This is huge and enables one to have an extremely good long swim if you want with lots of loungers nearby to enjoy the the views over Victoria Harbour.

If you want a room with a great view of Victoria Harbour you need to ask for ( and be prepared to pay for) a Tower room with a harbour view above 7th floor. Otherwise the rooms in the old part of the hotel can have views obsured by the space museum opposite.

Overall I would thproughly recommend the Peninsula if you like traditional city Grande Dame hotels. Its like a larger version of Claridges in a City where so many of the alternatives are modern, slick and homogenous."
282,Date of stay: December 2018,50,10/10 Service,"This time we visited, it was Christmas time and The Peninsula does not hold back on the decorations. The interior and exterior of the hotel was beautifully decorated (but not excessive where it was offensive & in your face). I even bought a few Xmas tree decorations home!

From the moment we stepped into the Rolls Royce to checking out, all the staff (cleaners, bell boys, bar staff, concierge) we encountered had impeccable service.

The room was well appointed with all the amenities expected from a luxury hotel.

We had the Dim Sim lunch at Spring Moon and that was nothing short of deliciousness. The chive and prawn dumplings were one of the best I’ve tasted and the duck pancakes were divine - with the right amount of crispy skin and moist duck meat.

Hong Kong is one of our favourite cities to visit and we hope to be back at the Peninsula soon."
283,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Still the Gran Dame of the Peninsula Group,"It is not an exaggeration to say that the Peninsula Hong Kong started it all - the definition of luxury hotels. I first stayed here on a trip to Hong Kong when I was 10 years old in 1989. I am pleased to report that the Peninsula has not only kept up its standards, but they have also exceeded them. In a word - it is superb. The most luxurious hotel stay I've ever experienced. To do it right, don't hesitate to splurge on the extras - reserve the Rolls Royce for an airport pick-up and drop-off, spend a few more hundred dollars a night for the Harbor Views, try the Detox breakfast (in-room dining). If you are staying here, do it the ""right"" way - you won't regret it. The experience is one of a kind. The Peninsula is truly magical.

PS The Kowloon side of Hong Kong offers the quintessential ""Hong Kong"" skyline views. Definitely worth staying in a room that offers Harbor Views."
284,Date of stay: November 2018,50,A World Famous Classic Hotel Worth the Stay,"A phenomenal hotel conveniently located in the middle of everything. Absolutely worth staying in. Do take advantage of them working you into the very popular afternoon tea setting as a guest of the hotel, and if you are feeling saucy, take the Rols Royce to the airport. Its awesome."
285,Date of stay: December 2018,40,A Wonderful Hotel,"We stayed here for three nights during December 2018. It was our second visit. The service, ambience and amenities are all excellent and can’t be faulted. My only ‘gripe’ is that the very large reception area was always chilly and put me off enjoying breakfast or having a drink there"
286,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Decadent Afternoon Tea Treat,"I really wanted to visit this hotel after reading about it in Gweilo, a historical biography of a boy growing up in HK, and although now a heightened luxury too end hotel, afternoon Christmas Tea didn’t disappoint. A little bit on the expensive side, but a girl deserves a treat. Beautiful decorations, excellent service and glorious cakes! Splash out and enjoy and be sure to visit the Christmas train scene in the second floor,"
287,Date of stay: September 2018,50,Classic hotel of Hong Kong,"This is the landmark of Hong Kong. I really enjoy staying here, the Rolls Royce Airport Pick up is wonderful experience. The room, breakfast, afternoon Tea are very nice. It is a nice time in hong kong at Peninsula."
288,Date of stay: December 2018,10,Disastrous stay,"Stayed in one of the Grand Deluxe Harbour View Suites for one night. Although the suite I stayed in was one of the most expensive in the hotel (just below their two presidential suites), the stay was far from satisfactory due to a number of defects:

1. I checked in very late in the night (around 11pm) due to prior business meetings. When I checked in, the guy at the front desk (who by the way never smiled once during our brief interaction) first refused to take my credit card (I subsequently called my bank who confirmed that my card was fine). Then I asked him whether I can have a late check-out given that I checked in very late. He did not know how to handle it and had to ask another girl at the front desk to help. The attitude of that other girl was not any friendlier either. She first told me that they can only have late checkout until 1pm. I insisted for a while and she finally told me that they are making a huge exception in this case by allowing me to check out at 2pm, and she made it sound like that she was doing me a huge favour that has never been given before. I find this whole experience very bizarre. Even if your firm policy does not permit late checkout or if you do not have sufficient authority, there must be a more polite way to convey that message. As a matter of fact I know that Peninsula does allow late check out as I have been offered late check out at other Peninsula hotels without even asking.
2. When I arrived at the suite (by the way, the guy who checked me in did not introduce anything about the suite and just left), I realised that there were only two small bottles (330 ml) of water provided. I called housekeeping who provided two more bottles, but for a suite of this calibre shouldn't Peninsula provide more water from the beginning?
3. Then I took a shower and one of the shower heads was broken...so I decided to take a bath instead, and realised that there was no product to use for the bath at all (no bath salt or anything). I called housekeeping again who initially could not understand what I was asking for. It took me 5 minutes on the phone and many repeats at ""bath salt"" before the operator finally understood and sent someone to bring the bath salt.
4. At this point I have almost given up, but then the most ridiculous thing during the whole stay happened. I went to bed at around 1:45am and immediately felt that there was something very hard in the bed. It turned out that there was a yoga menu underneath the bed sheet (not sure whether it was left there by the housekeeper or the previous guest)! I had to call the housekeeping once again (the third service call that I had to make since arrival) to ask for the bed sheets to be changed.
5. Finally on the day of departure I tried to find a paper bag in the suite to store some personal items and after a 5-minute search could not find anything. This is a trivial point but again, shouldn't this be one of the standard amenities for a hotel like the Peninsula?

I have stayed in many Peninsula hotels in Bangkok, Beijing, Shanghai and Tokyo before but this is the first time that I stay in their property in Hong Kong. However, given the bad experience I find it very hard to believe how this can be considered their flagship property in the world. One thing that I (and many of my friends) have observed over the past few years is that Peninsula as a group is cutting costs, and the quality of their hotels have deteriorated significantly. Maybe this is also a result of this cost cutting strategy.

P.S. I have complained about these issues with the front desk upon checkout and requested to speak to one of the hotel managers. However, they were all ""occupied"" so no one ever acknowledged these issues in person. Someone from the hotel (who claims to be a manager) did call after my stay, and only half-heartedly promised that they will note these issues down and ensure that they will not happen again if I stay in the future. It sounded like he was saying these things just to finish the conversation as soon as possible. This is very poor service recovery in my opinion, as these issues should not have happened in the first place. I am not asking for compensation but a sincere apology in person (even just send a card) would have helped a lot. Instead everyone at Peninsula was very passive and no one ever reached out to try to resolve any issue. I will not stay at any Peninsula hotels anymore and will ask all my friends and family to avoid Peninsula in the future."
289,Date of stay: December 2018,50,Recognised as one of the best in Hong Kong and the Peninsular lived up to its reputation!,"Visited for 2 nights after a 2 week tour to Vietnam and the Peninsular was the crowning glory of what has been a superb trip. The hotel is known for its style and luxury and we were not disappointed from the welcome , the check in , in fact the quality throughout.
We had a 17th floor harbour view room with every modern amenity you could wish for - even a fax and a stapler!! Lots of touch buttons for TV , lights curtains etc.
Buffet breakfast excellent . The roof top bar and restaurant with panoramic views very good though booking recommended. It’s not cheap by the way but it’s worth that special occasion.
We were given a late checkout to 3 pm but use of the superb pool and spa area to relax which was most welcome.
Special recommendation for all the staff we came into contact with who could not have been more attentive , professional and friendly.
All in all a very special hotel and experience."
290,Date of stay: November 2018,50,No better time and place to arrive in Hong Kong,"Returning to The Peninsula Hotel is always a pleasure but by chance our arrival coincided with their 'beginning of Christmas' event in the lobby. Lots of excitement, a parade, music and drinks and canapés.
Our corner suite right at the front of the hotel was really comfortable one every possible way and requests for anything were dealt with almost instantaneously.
Breakfast in the lobby was very good, preceded by a visit to the spa and pool, which are excellent"
291,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Afternoon tea,"First of all I should say we weren’t resident at the hotel but as it was our last day in Hong Kong we wanted to mark the occasion with a last treat.
We arrived a little early and even though it was a Monday the queue for afternoon tea had already begun.
The afternoon tea is expensive but it’s pretty special. The occasion is enjoyed in a most wonderful colonial setting and you feel the history all around you enjoying your afternoon tea whilst a string quartet play from a balcony. The history of the venue is so interesting particularly the WW2 era when the Imperial Japanese army established its military headquarters in the hotel. It’s just a great thing to do and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
292,Date of stay: December 2018,40,Becoming irrelevant,"It pains me to say this but this Peninsula is a has-been. It feels irrelevant now. I wish I had stayed at Upper House.

I didn’t feel any charm or warmth. The hotel feels like a convention center. There isn’t a really lobby where you can sit while you wait for someone or for a cab for example. The lobby is a giant restaurant and it feels awkward and impersonal to walk into the hotel the first time as if you’re interrupting someone’s dinner.

Service was subpar. Once while eating in the lobby someone just completely forgot about me. I had to get out of my chair and track someone down. No one greeted me warmly or remembered my name - that’s because this hotel doesn’t care about that anymore. It cares about making money from people who aren’t even staying at the hotel and come for tea. It was pouring rain when I was there. First I was given a broken umbrella. They made me sign out for is with my room number like a criminal - agin this is because they have turned the place into an impersonal convention center. When I asked the gentlemen at the front door for a new umbrella I was simply point back inside where I wandered aimlessly until I could find someone to assist. Why couldn’t an employee simply do this for me?

My room service was downright gross and inedible. I did like the size of the room and the amenities in the room.

The most redeeming thing about this hotel is their spa. It almost feels like it is under completely separate management. It was clean and beautiful. And everyone working at the spa from start to finish was stellar. I would have given 3 stars but for the spa.

Peninsula, step it up."
293,Date of stay: December 2018,40,Still very beautiful,"At this price point, a hotel should not look its age and The Pen definitely delivers in all aesthetic aspects. Even after the 2012 refurbishment, the hotel still looks and feels familiar to returning guests. Nothing too drastic changed in terms of look and feel, and guests who have had the chance to stay there through the course of the past decade or more will find that the hotel looks better with age. Service recovery, for what little grouses I had, was on point and efficient. The lobby is a little too busy for my liking, as the perennially popular restaurant draws in the crowds (and noise). But once I depart the lobby and head to my room, it’s nice and silent and best of all, I hardly even hear the traffic along the busy street. The indoor pool is blissfully heated, and faces the gorgeous HK Island."
294,Date of stay: November 2018,50,The Grand Dame of the Far East lives up to her storied reputation,"The world famous Peninsula try lives up to it's haloed reputation!

I visited the PHK for two nights on a recent family trip it truly met all expectations! From the moment we passed through customs at HKG we were immediately whisked away to our waiting Rolls Royce for the 30 min ride to the hotel. Arriving by Rolls Royce is definitely the way to go when staying at the Peninsula.

Upon arrival we were greeted by a large number of waiting staff ready to open the door for you and welcome you to one of the world's finest hotels. I was excited to see the Peninsula's 1934 Rolls Royce Phantom II parked outside the main entrance when we arrived!

We were immediately lead to our superior suite on the 5th floor where were able to check-in in room! We arrived in the early morning so it was very nice that our room was available immediately. I would have preferred one of the superior suites in the front of the hotel with a better view, but ultimately the weather wasn't amazing during our stay so the view would not have been that great anyway.

The room was exceptional with every luxury amenities and convenience imaginable. Everything from the lighting to the climate to concierge request could be do via ipad or the electronic controls in each room. The superior suite featured an enormous dressing room which was convenient with 3 people staying in the suite. The main living room was very large with a sectional sofa and desk and built in tv cabinet with mini bar and nespresso station. There also an additional bed set up in this living room with really nice linens, I felt much nicer than typical roll away! the bedroom featured a huge king bed and plenty of space as well. The bathroom was large with double vanities, a large soaking tub, shower, and separate toilet area. There was also a built in TV in the bath and all the same electronic controls as the rest of the suite. The Oscar de la Renta bath amenities we very nice. The only minor comment I have is that the baths feel a bit dated compared to the rest of the room as they were not fully renovated in the 2013 redo and still feel a little 1990's with green marble and older style fixtures. Nonetheless, they are very luxurious. Upon arrival there was a fresh fruit basket, chocolates, fresh squeezed juices, and bottled water waiting in the room as a welcome amenity.

During our stay we received complimentary buffet breakfast at the verandah through American Express, which was excellent. The service at breakfast was excellent. I really appreciated the full formal table settings and silver tea service used. It really made the experience special. We also tried Felix, the bar/restaurant at the top of the hotel. The views were exceptional and cocktails very good (albeit very expensive).

The spa, pool, and fitness areas were also top notch. The same superlative service existed everywhere throughout the hotel. Upon arrival at the gym you immediately were offered bottle mineral water and a towel. Service was very personalized, which is what really makes the difference in this hotel.

The concierge was also extremely good, securing all dining reservations requested and organizing all transportation.

Upon departure, the PHK agent at HKG will help you with your bags and airline check-in and will even escort you all that way to security! What service. Our course, all this comes at a price, but you get what you pay for!

I can't say enough about this superb property and I can't wait to stay there again in the future!"
295,Date of stay: August 2018,50,An Oasis in the Hustle and Bustle.,"After a full day of taking all of Hong Kong in including: shopping, site seeing, eating, etc. there is nothing like knowing you will be able to come back to The Peninsula hotel which is an oasis in the hustle and bustle of this amazing city. Walking into the lobby during tea time is like being able to plop yourself in the most warm and welcoming place that immediately rejuvenates you and you forget how exhausted you are. The service of the staff is truly concierge and they aim to please. The rooms are extremely comfortable and the bed was so warm and soft that upon our return I couldn't sleep in my own bed any longer. I went out and bought a bed and basically tried to replicate my bed experience from The Peninsula. If you can afford it, don't think twice. Book your room today!!!!"
296,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Out of this world,This hotel from the moment you walk in is incredible the staff opened the gym early for me when I couldn’t sleep due to jet lag the views from the restaurant are out of this world staff are very attentive the car service is amazing staff are clean professional and helpful definitely return again!
297,Date of stay: June 2018,40,Beautiful and Extremely Expensive,"My family came to surprise me in Hong Kong and we stayed here for two nights. The room is clean and beautiful with the most amazing view. We ordered room service for breakfast and tried their buffet lunch. Everything provided was beautiful and tasted so fresh. I think they really put emphasis to make sure the ingredients are of the highest quality.

The service however was quite minimal. We waited a long time for someone to bring our luggage up to the room and when we ready to check out, there was a wait for the luggage too. The check in counter was also quite plain and there were only two staff while it was quite busy. I didn't feel they provided five star service.

Although the stay was pleasant I just didn't feel like i got my money's worth. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful and prestigious hotel, but I've stayed in many hotels in Hong Kong and the price we paid for the suite + food we could have gotten a nicer room and service elsewhere. My husband was literally muttering to himself why did he chose this place.

I still think it was worth visiting and experiencing the hotel but we won't be back next time."
298,Date of stay: November 2018,40,Very pleasant high tea,"Very pleasant high tea in an excellent setting where the staff where efficient and courteous the quality of the high tea offered was also excellent, all against a background of a very competent small orchestra playing at just the right volume, If you like high, a must if you visit Hong Kong."
299,Date of stay: October 2018,40,Outstanding hotel and service. Very expensive. Food service let’s it down.,"We had a short stay of only a few nights and thoroughly enjoyed the stay from the moment we arrived and were escorted to reception and subsequently shown our room. The room had fantastic views over the harbour to Hong Kong Island (well worth the extra cost without a scintilla of doubt). The overall architecture and decor of the building was terrific. Service was excellent throughout.
The room was very well equipped and spacious (for Hong King) with en-suite with both bath and shower. The technology with multiple PC tablets at all convenient points of the room to control everything, and I do mean everything.
We had breakfast in the foyer one day and were distinctly underwhelmed by the measly portions. The breakfast in the buffet restaurant, although more expensive, was much better value with a huge range and choice. One complaint though, on one occasion we arrived 15 minutes before breakfast was due to end. But instead of letting existing diners finish selecting they started clearing food away on the stroke of 10.00. They should most definitely let existing diners continue longer, even if they closed the restaurant to new entries at 10.00."
300,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Great experience!,"I was attracted by the newly launched 360 degrees photos function. It is a great tech because I can preview in 360 degrees. And I found the photos present the real appearance.

The overall services were excellent and attentive. The restaurant at the Peninsula exceeded my expectation. The food was very delicious. The best thing was the location. The harbour mountain views in Hongkong is really great. Although the price was quite high, I will definitely visit again."
301,Date of stay: November 2018,50,Best hotel in HK hands down,"Amazing facilities, great view of the harbour from the sun deck, good restaurant options (check out Gaddis). Overall very happy with the stay, the first room we stayed at on the 5th Floor had smells of cigarette even though we asked for a non-smoking room, but once we told the front desk about it we were promptly switched into another room with no issue."
302,Date of stay: November 2018,40,Still a Peninsula but why does it not feel like that,"I stayed here for 5 days. Having stayed in Paris multiple times and in Bangkok I feel that there is something missing here.
Most of the staff are doing their best and it’s the people who are still the most important making our stay amazing but over all this property is missing the Peninsula brand feel.
Complained about food which was mediocre at the most. Service is slow .
Hope they fix things here or the brand will lose my loyalty for sure.

Good luck"
303,Date of stay: September 2018,50,Amazing stay as always,"Can't say enough nice things about this hotel. My favorite hotel when visiting Hong Kong.

Location, service and class a step above all the others.

A little on the pricy side, but thankfully my company always sets me up here.

Best hotel in Kowloon side."
304,Date of stay: October 2018,40,Elegant,"I have been in HK more than 20 times, this is one of my favourites hotel.
Extremely elegant grand old hotel situated in Kowloon.
Close to major upmarket shopping malls, restaurants and ferry.
Lovely lobby with quartet playing music."
305,Date of stay: October 2018,50,Best hotel in HK,"Everything about this hotel is amazing. From services, room and dining. I have been celebrating many important events of my life at this colonial hotel. Always recommending to my friends. Simply this best!"
306,Date of stay: October 2018,50,Greatest 5th Year Wedding Anniversary,"My wife and I spent our 5th Year Anniversary in The Peninsula Hong Kong. This is truly an extraordinary hotel, where their superb staff makes you feel at home all the time. Hazel at the front desk excelled with her warm reception and service, she truly made us feel special guests all the time.
Hotel premises, room distribution, restaurants, food, service, location, and extraordinary Harbour view made our experience unique. Luxury at all levels.
We visited the Spa and had a “Time Together” package, which was a world class experience. Perfect for an anniversary celebration.
Without a doubt, this will be our “home away from home” when we return to Hong Kong!"
307,Date of stay: January 2018,40,Really good,"Stayed here for 2 weeks and the service we got was amazing , room service was excellent , rooms are clean and smart and comfortable. If you’re looking for luxury this is the place to find it. We had private cars fetch us and drop us. It’s in the heart of TST and if you like shopping there is a luxury mall connected to the hotel. Rooms 8/10 and high tea was great.

Thanks"
308,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Just WOW,"This hotel is one of those “once in a lifetime” moments, you might as well pinch yourself because it doesn’t get much better then this. The hotel is designed to PERFECTION! Everything is exactly where you want it to be, and everything is of the highest quality possible – you don’t have to leave this hotel EVER! However, if you do decide to leave your room, don’t go too far – the hotel lobby offer one of the most luxuries experiences in Hong Kong, High tea in The Peninsula is an extremely popular activity and the lines can normally be an hour long, but as a hotel guest you receive a table immediately and I advise you to take it.
This hotel is simply one of the best, I have not a single bad thing to say about it – Book your room in the Peninsula TODAY"
309,Date of stay: October 2018,50,Brilliant,"The service and staff are second to none. Our room had all the modern gadgets you would expect and more.
Afternoon tea was delicious as was all the food.
When I’m here next I will look no further. Very close to Canton road and all the shops.
The harbour view is worth the extra at 8pm"
310,Date of stay: October 2018,50,Old but Gold,"The hotel looks old from the outside but what it holds inside was anything but old. The hotel’s staff are warm and welcoming. The rooms are similar to the ones in
Paris. The service is impeccable. This is the hotel to be in Hong Kong if you want a lighter wallet and it has nothing to do with the hotel itself. It has a shopping arcade that is a who’s who of names that would make the men cry and the eyes of the ladies dance. The restaurants are great and the food selection is impressive."
311,Date of stay: September 2018,50,Superb,"I'm quite happy with a hotel if it's clean, well-equipped and convenient, so the Peninsula, where I have eaten a number of times before while in HK, was a luxurious treat and didn't disappoint. The service is friendly and personal, the room top-notch, with space, high-end fixtures and amenities and a bathroom you could spend hours in. I had a harbour view on the 22nd floor, directly opposite the Convention Centre, so it really was the plum spot in the whole former colony."
312,Date of stay: August 2018,50,Amazing and Breath Taking,"This is my first trip to Hong Kong ,from the minute i reached the hotel ; I love everything about it ,the vintage and distinguishing style,the rooms and how spacious ,high tech ,clean,quite .Also how are the staff very helpful and so friendly all the time .I also eat breakfast at the veranda restaurant daily ,they have everything you desire to start your day with .There were many selections of restaurants for dinner and i tried them all ,they were outstanding in all ways ..the small detail i would like to mention it that whenever you need to use a taxi ,they give you a small card with both languages ""English and Chinese"" to help you in any direction you want to go .
The location is perfect because it is close to every place you need to go .
I tried their spa and it was a royal treatment and so professional..highly recommended .
If i will ever go back to Hong Kong i will be in this hotel again"
313,Date of stay: September 2018,50,First Trip to Hong Kong,"While my first trip to China this wasn’t my first Peninsula.

The location was close to multiple shopping malls, across the street from the ferry and close to the subway.

From the time we arrived to the time we left...everything was terrific. The lobby was very open with a lounge and restaurant. During the evening there was live music on the weekends. While there was a large retail area attached to the hotel you didn’t feel that there was a lot of non-hotel traffic passing through the lobby.

As with most hotels of this caliber the floral arrangements were beautiful and fresh.

Since we were on a tour we ate breakfast at The Verandah each morning. The food offerings were diverse to appeal to a local and national audience. Everything was fresh and there was a bar with fresh congee and another for eggs. Staff was impeccable. Very outgoing and attentive.

We did have dinner at Felix one night. Again, everything was fresh and the staff was terrific.

You can’t complain about the rooms. They are spacious with huge closets with a place for two large suitcases on the bar by the door. Love the valet door as it is a terrific way to send out laundry or get messages/room drops.

The bedroom is high tech with a tablet and touch controls for lighting and shades. The vanity has a hidden lighted mirror that rises out of the desk. Only concern is that if you aren’t a woman you won’t want to use the dryer there, but that is the only place it appeared to have the correct plug.

Bathrooms were large with a full bath, double sinks, shower and a glass door for the toilet.

Room was pretty quiet even with it being right off the hall from the elevator. There were doors that could close off from the closer area, but they had an open weave at the bottom and useless to reduce ambient hall noise. We didn’t need it as the doors and walls were pretty solid.

This would be on my list when I return to Hong Kong."
314,Date of stay: September 2018,50,Lovely hotel. A true Five-Star.,"This is the flagship hotel on the Kowloon side that started it all for the Peninsula chain. It was wonderful. The young lady who checked us in escorted us to our room to show us all of the room’s features.

The complaints we have were that all the public areas were way too cold and that afternoon tea was not served in the gracious manner you would expect...it was slapped down in front of us by servers who seemed to be ready to leave for the day. Only once did a server offer to pour more tea. Based on their reputation and for the price, this should have been a much better experience.

Breakfast on the first floor was much better. There was a very extensive selection of foods. If you wanted coffee or juice, the server brought it to your table. If you wanted eggs cooked to order, you told the chef, and the eggs were delivered to your table so you didn’t have to wait in line.

Our room was on the 29th floor with a fantastic view of the harbor and Hong Kong on the other side. It was a large deluxe room with three iPad like tablets that controlled everything from the lights to the television to the curtains. The bathroom had a shower and a bathtub with a television at one end of the tub so you could watch while you soaked. There were two separate sinks on rather side of the bathroom...one with a magnifying makeup mirror. The entryway had the closet, drawers, a shelf for luggage, and a special cabinet in case you had packages delivered.

The bedroom had a television, a table with two chairs, a sofa, a desk and a vanity table complete with a makeup mirror that raised at the push of a button, the hair dryer and a nail dryer in case you decided to paint your nails. There was also a drawer that contained a computer printer in case you required that.

The bed was fine and comfortable. The only noise we heard was from the room above where someone appeared to be jumping up and down on the floor at odd hours one night. The pillows were a bit odd...no heft to them at all.

This is what a five star hotel should be."
315,Date of stay: September 2018,50,Best place on the Kowloon Side,"This is our second visit to the hotel and we are once again very happy! By far one of our favorite hotels around the world. On the Kowloon side gives you a great view of the harbor and Hong Kong Central. Subway is a quick 5-minute walk getting you almost everywhere in Hong Kong. Plenty of restaurants to select from. Afternoon tea here seems to a big deal so reserve a table! Service here is what it's all about. Everyone we encountered was kind and very respectful. We traveled on my birthday and was greeted with a birthday dessert. This made my trip that more memorable. Special shout out to Henry Ho for the amazing personalized service we received during our stay. I'll be coming back to Hong Kong, and I won't stay anywhere else!"
316,Date of stay: August 2018,50,Good restaurant,The restaurant at the Peninsular is as you would expect from a hotel of this ranking. The service was good and attentive. The food was good as you would expect from a hotel of the class. However it was not outstanding and we had equal elsewhere at a cheaper price. However we would visit again and enjoyed the meal.
317,Date of stay: April 2018,50,good location,The hotel is not far from the shopping district and the mass transit system. The rooms are clean but the price is quite high compared to the services provided. You can book other hotels better at the same price.
318,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Best Hotel I've stayed in HK,"Out of all my trips to HK this is by far the best hotel!
Love how they combine classic opulence with modern technology. There's complimentary handy phone with all calls free, international calls included. The tablet controlling the room is very easy to use as well.
Service is excellent.
Sadly my room is on the lower floor and got no views...next time need to book a harbour view room surely..."
319,Date of stay: October 2017,50,We stayed at this fabulous hotel for the electronics fair,"We were on the upper floor facing the harbour- our office team from dubai were busy setting up our display at the exhibition center for electronic products...the hotel is smack above the exhibition center- and from our room we were mesmerised by the views of the ferries going to and from kowloon- what a mystical sight... the rooms are well- furnished, the food is good, but best is the location and the harbour and mountain views- Hongkong really is a fragrant harbour ."
320,Date of stay: July 2018,50,Best,"Wow ,if you want perfection, this is it,once again no for the faint hearted!although it in Kowloon,it’s only the star ferrie away from central.If you want the hotel has a range of
Cars BMW,MERCEDES,Or the hotels collection of Rolls Royce’s.My Choice.
Great rooms Harbour view best.
Bath rooms,Sublime,Even Television in the mirrors!They have personalised stationary upon arrival.Chopper flights are easy , plus’s tours anywhere you want.Breakfast Buffet is all you could want, almost want to live there! So many resteraunts it’s perfect.
If you want pure old school beauty and organisation it’s your best stop."
321,Date of stay: May 2018,50,Understandable why this hotel was #1 in the world for so long!,"This was a top notch experience, and we have stayed at several Peninsula Hotels around the world now. First, with a suite, you are picked up at the airport in a Rolls Royce; check-in was smooth. The suite we had enjoyed gorgeous views of Victoria Harbor from the Kowloon side. The suite was huge and well-appointed. There is a very nice pool on one of the floors; breakfast in the lobby was just classically wonderful. I attach a few photos of the room and view. Location is great at southern tip of Kowloon- close to the ferry, malls, shopping. Book the suite if you can- I have no regrets and would definitely do it all over again if the opportunity avails me such."
322,Date of stay: August 2018,50,The most luxurious hotel I have visited!,"We were celebrating a special anniversary by returning to Hong Kong and stayed 7 nights at The Peninsula. It was spectacular. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable, polite - just lovely. Every member of staff we met for a whole week from concierge to waiters to maids- was delightful.
This hotel rightly prides itself on its service. It trains everyone to a very high standard.
The facilities are amazing a plethora of places to eat, drink or watch the world go by. A stunning pool and spa complex.
It was little touches that I will remember like being greeted by name by any member of staff as you walk by or as you approach an employee, it is a VERY impressive place."
323,Date of stay: December 2017,50,The experience never to be missed,What can you say.... The peninsula Hong Kong is the foundation of fine hotel accommodation. From the moment you arrive you are treated to the finest of service. The rooms are exquisitely furnished and have the latest of technology. The dining offerings are many and varied. The beds are some of the most comfortable I have slept in
324,Date of stay: June 2018,50,Flagship Peninsula - Sets Standards in Luxury,"As a regular Peninsula Hotels guest, this was our first trip to the property in Hong Kong. We were in intrigued to see how the flagship property compared ...

First impressions with a Rolls-Royce transfer from the airport were impressive and matched by the rooms which have been recently luxuriously renovated and equipped with the latest technology. We enjoyed the fantastic harbour view.

Service was slightly less personal than Peninsula Beverly Hills or New York as it is a bigger hotel but still attentive with everything you might need. Spa was the most impressive of any Peninsula hotel we've visited - resort standard in a city hotel."
325,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Just Perfection,"We booked at this amazing place for a treat for the wife. It was a surprise for a combined birthday and wedding anniversary. This was a while ago and I'm really sorry that it's taken me this long to get round to doing a review.

We had the (surprise) dinner party in Sai Kung Royal Yacht Club and I'd asked for a Rolls to pick us up and take us to TST. All of the Rolls were out but they sent us a limo. Fantastic.

When we arrived we were given an upgrade and upon entering the room we had a cake. Amazing.

Everything about our stay could not be faulted. The staff, brilliant. The room, we didn't want to leave. The first night we went out and upon arrival we watched a Disney movie in the bath, how lazy were we. Our stay could not have been bettered in anyway.

Thank you. We highly recommend a stay at this beautiful hotel."
326,Date of stay: October 2017,50,The Queen of all Hotels,"Peninsulas are always special, and this one is the first one. Grand old building. Well located. Fabulous service but not intrusive. We had a beautiful suite --and the suites came with a car and driver for 3 hours every day. Everything was PERFECT, but it wouldn't be a Peninsula if not perfect.
The lower floors have many high-end shops. Hermes, ST Dupont, etc. Some are small chains, some individual stores. All very nice.
A Breakfast buffet was served every day with more food than you have ever seen in one place. Delicious.
It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for here.
Look at the ""offers"" on their website. We got the 3rd night free."
327,Date of stay: December 2017,50,The best hotel I have been to !!!!!,"This hotel has a very good service. When I arrived at the airport, the hotel had a golf cart to picked up me and my family from the gate to the immigration counter. After we had passed the immigration, there have two hotel staffs help us to collected our luggages at the baggage claim. Then, they took me to the car to go to the hotel. It was the best limousine car ever. It was Rolls Royce Phantom. When I arrived at the hotel, the hotel staff took me and my family to the room. I had booked 2 rooms for me and my family. There has a wellcome drinks and afternoon tea vouchers for us. I stayed in 15th floor and I can see the Hong Kong view. It was very beautiful. The hotel have many service for the hotel guests. For example, there have sauna room,massage room,heated pool, etc. In the room, we can turn on-off TV, open-close the curtain,turn on-off the lights and do many things in the tablets. In the barthroom,there have all of facilities and the thing that make me very exited is there has a TV in the bathroom. The hotel have many free movies that we can watched it for free. And the last thing that I very liked it is there are many brandname shops in the hotel, for example Louis Vuitton,Hermes,Goyard,etc. The hotel has a limousine car to took me and my family to the airport to go back to Bangkok. It was the best trip that I have ever been."
328,Date of stay: August 2018,50,Colonial,"High tea at the Peninsula is a luxurious yet relaxed experience. Having paid > £100 the previous day for below average Chinese food, the combination of the surroundings, the ambience, the exquisite service and the delicate delights on offer at this Colonial ‘palace’ meant £40pp (including tea/coffee) seemed a bargain.
Perhaps not ideal for someone with a healthy appetite & but an absolute must for a special occasion."
329,Date of stay: July 2018,50,One of the best hotels I have been to,"The hotel is stunning, with some of the best shops around located in the building. The staff was spectacular, very kind and attentive yet warm and not stuffy. The buffet breakfast was the best I’ve had. Rooms were clean, updated and plenty of amenities. Would highly recommend. You won’t be disappointed!"
330,Date of stay: January 2018,40,"Great hotel, but better with the ""adds-on""","I think it's a bit overrated (for average travelers) - if you only get its room.

Don't get me wrong: The room is one of the best of hotels' room I've stayed in my life. Every little detail in the room (or at the hotels) is at the highest quality - it's phenomenal. From the doorknob all the way thru the bedding-it's top of the class.

But, in order for you to even experience what ""The Peninsula"" hotel means you gotta' be ready to spend much more pretty pennies. The high teas (you gotta reserve that first - way in advance), the breakfast (Awesome breakfast and expensive, then you also have to consider a lot of good food options around the premises already, is it worth the price?)

Location - is the best for tourist and sightseeing, placed right in the heart of tourist attractions. Did I mention great restaurant (food) all around? and super easy access everywhere (train, walk, taxis).

There's no DOUBT that I would spend many more times at this great hotel!"
331,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Business and Pleasure in Hong Kong,"I stayed at the hotel in April as I was attending the fair at the convention centre and it is next door. I upgraded to a harbour view and was well worth it despite the road works. Staff, catering and amenities are great I as travelling on my own and found customer service was really good. Swimming pool, gym and spa were lovely and for a first visit it was a good choice as next time I can now navigate the walk ways and might look to stay on Kowloon. I did 3 days of sight seeing and saw all the main attractions and 4 days of work."
332,Date of stay: November 2017,40,Good but not as polished like the old days,"After visiting the Peninsula Hong Kong, i felt it’s a beautiful hotel that lost its old world charm. While the staff are hard working, more could be done to make all guests feel welcomed. I had a few not so good experiences with the concierge desk, dealing with some rather curt employees. I know they deal with many people and issues on a daily basis but there was a lack of professionalism I wouldn’t have expected to see at the flagship hotel if the Peninsula brand. Rooms are exquisite and wonderfully comfortable. I did not eat in the hotel."
333,Date of stay: July 2018,40,Nice weekend,"Amazing service with an awesome smile, relaxing room, staff are friendly and accommodating from the guards on duty, east check-in and check-out and hassle free.
Were surely come back soon, kudos!!!!!!!"
334,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Very attentive staff,"Enjoyed great dining experience in one of the restaurants, their staff is very attentive to our needs, food is fresh and taste great. Highly recommend to those who wanted to meet important business partners and celebrate your special dates with loved ones."
335,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Nice trip,"We stayed here for one night.. it's very good hotel in very good location, you will always see staff will smiling face. They will help you in evwry possible way to make your stay comfortable. Its bit expensive but worth stayi g here at this price."
336,Date of stay: June 2018,30,Local Staycation,"I’m writing this review on my mummy behalf.

The limo came and pick us up and already acknowledged my daddy family name wrongly. The suite is booked under my mummy name but the family name the limo driver addressed my dad with neither my dad nor my mum last name.

After checking into the Grand Deluxe Harbour view suite I already pointed out to them the problem I have with the sliding door between the dressing room and the bedroom the lady who helped us checked in has acknowledge the problem and assured me that they will fix it but it’s not done on the day we checked in. During the checked in they registered both my dad and mum name and when we had dinner at spring noon that evening they still keep addressing my daddy with my mummy family name. Dinner at Spring Moon was kinda disappointing we had a reservation very early at 6pm even though the restaurant was not crowded they seated us at a table very near to a staff entrance and lots of staff was walking in and out but nobody bothered to change our plates or cutlery. Ok I’ve to admit that though I’m a Chinese boy but I’m horrible with chopsticks therefore my plate is super dirty.

Pic 1 and 2 is the dust on the dressing table in the dressing room. My dad and me have terrible allergy to dust.

Pic 3 the noodle my mum ordered from Spring Moon for room service was tasteless and hard.

Pic 4 and 5 the bread from the room service was really burnt

Pic 6 and 7 the drawer was labelled as snack but it was all bar amenities.

Pic 8 and 9 the drawer was labelled as bar amenities but it was all snacks.

The kid duvet provided for the extra bed was a hazard. The opening up the duvet cover was so wide that my foot got trapped in it a few times in the night and I’m surprised that no action was taken previously till I
complained.

We have stayed in a lot of hotel suite both in Hong Kong and overseas and being a Hong Konger I’m always very proud of The Peninsula as a iconic hotel representing Hong Kong like when people travel to Paris and they would relate The Ritz with Paris. This stay had been a bitter sweet experience for me and family.

We have expected a really luxurious hotel with fantastic and seamless service but it was kind of disappointing with the housekeeping and the room service food quality.

However I need to thank some for specific people. Thank you Uncle Joseph and Henry for arranging and bringing me to that special tour.

Thank you auntie Ada and Marble for the special breakfast arrangement and the special room amenities.

I really hope I can convince my dad and mum to return to The Peninsula for another staycation or to put my overseas relative at The Peninsula whenever they visit Hong Kong.

Brandan Lee"
337,Date of stay: October 2017,40,Classic and Expensive,"Peninsula is one of those hotels with such high reputation that once you step in (whether or not is your personal biases playing around) you feel it - the floors are different, the people are different, and of course, the offerings are different.

Subjectively speaking: I love their classical live band (they have it in their lobby lounge and a piano in the bar). It makes you feel like royalty, and its not a bad way to spend your money at all. I also love their white uniforms, oriental tea pots in room and the fact that they have a piano room (GRAND PIANO; however its a little out of tune) in an exclusive looking lounge !! (which other hotels have this?) Also the fact that they don't really advertise this - makes it a whole lot more special!

Objectively speaking: To be honest, you can get similar offerings in terms of room quality, location and all these other factors elsewhere with a significantly lower price. Hotel ICON is one example. The rooms aren't large (smaller than new world millennium actually) but I have to mention their amenities are exceptional.

Peninsula is one of Hong Kong's icon and it will be, for a long time. Recommend to try their bar and walk around the property a little bit."
338,Date of stay: July 2018,50,STILL THE BEST AROIUND,"It has been a few years since my last stay here and things only get better.
From the minute we were collected from the airport in the green Phantom till when we left it was all perfect. The rooms are state of the art in in perfect order.
We used the pool and the staff were most attentive with water all the time etc. This place is a real treat to stay in and although in the 21st Century it has not lost any of it's traditional charm.
We ate in the Buffet which is an amazing eating experience and as good as you will find anywhere.
Only drawback is that this is a super expensive place to stay and eat and is not for the faint hearted."

340,Date of stay: August 2017,30,High Quality Stay (by the bay),"As an entrepreneur I travel internationally every week for business and need a good environment that is consistent and value driven. Felt welcolm'd and at peace here, the beds and outdoor pool was incredible. Customer service is good although can be outstanding. Sunday Afternoon tea is incredible. S"
341,Date of stay: July 2018,50,Luxury plus!,"One of my most favourite Hotels. The service is exemptlery, the rooms beautiful and the High tea not to be missed. If you want to spoil yourself in Hong Kong,you cannot go wrong . If you really want to lash out,have the Rolls Royce pick up from the airport and arrive in Style. I was lucky enough to get an upgrade, so felt very spoilt with a water front room. Catch the laser lights every night. Quite amazing. They always have a quartet playing in the foyer most afternoons and evenings. Wonderful!"
342,Date of stay: July 2018,50,True luxury,"Stay at the peninsula is must, I think everyone that goes to Hong Kong needs to stay there. because is a hotel with history and with a very good or excellent service.
From the arrival at the airport , where after the gate there is someone to escort you to the immigration, and baggage until you reach the Rolls Royce that is waiting for you.. AMAZING
And when you enter in the hotel you are welcome by the reception staff that will escort you street to you suit. no waiting time in check in nothing.. the hotel is always busy, because everyone from out side comes for the teat time and also for the shops..
the service is a must I don't remember other hotel in the world like this one.
please go and enjoy as much I did"
343,Date of stay: July 2018,50,My 8th visit and the service and hotel is PERFECTION,"This is my 8th trip to Hong Kong and one of the reasons I keep returning is because there is no hotel in the world that can match the service and luxuries here at the Peninsula Hong Kong.

I keep asking myself, will this get old? Well the answer is no. !! This is not only a hotel it is a feeling of friends and family , the staff will always remember things you talked about from previous trips they are so attentive to every detail and some of the details I would never think of . For example, while enjoying my afternoon tea my plate was messy and I was thinking, wouldn’t it be nice to have a new plate, these people read my mind. Within seconds of thinking this , the gentleman came by to give me a fresh plate

The concierge team works so hard before and during my trip to make sure my days went well and have my tickets for trains etc. this is the best concierge team in the world. I can say this because I have been so many places and so many 5 star hotels

The Peninsula Hong Kong is not just a place to stay its a home away from home. As large and intimidating it might be to some, this is the warmest, friendliest service oriented establishment.

The rooms are incredible , the views are incredible. This time I am staying in the 18th floor in room 1810. It’s amazing

The technology is the best of any hotel I have been in and the amenities supersede all hotels

Anyway. I am still here but wanted to review

If you re coming to Hong Kong. , this is the best and only place to stay. I am already thinking of my next visit

I’d rather come here then go anywhere else"
344,Date of stay: June 2018,40,Beautiful teatime location,"Definitely a wonderful place to go for teatime. The tea was excellent and pastries was not overly sweet. We had their chamomile and lemon tea. We lined up at 2 PM and finally got our seats at 4 PM. Teatime is from 2 PM to 6 PM. Highly suggest to go earlier and start lining up at 1:30 or even earlier if possible. It's great they have staff manage the line. Upstairs, they have musicians playing live classical music while we had our tea. That was one of the highlights of our trip. Bucket list checked, teatime in Hong Kong."
345,Date of stay: June 2018,50,Luxury hotel in convenient location!,"We had high expectations for our first trip to Hong Kong and they were certainly met! This is five star hotel in every way. It is a bit of a spectacle for tourists who line up to take photos out front and very popular for high tea. We were with our 13 yr old son and some of our favorites were the spa, fitness center and club sandwich poolside. My husband loved their hot tub and ice tub every day for the two weeks we were there! Perfect location for the metro and shopping close by in every direction. Would definitely stay there again and will try their other location on our next visit to Chicago."
346,Date of stay: November 2017,50,"Pure Class: Exquisite Hotel, Superior Service","This was my third time at The Peninsula in two years and every time it gets better and better.

Starting with their executive cars, which make the Hong Kong traffic more bearable with their smooth and pleasant rides.

The rooms are beautifully elegant and the service is superb.

They even remember our preferences for the type of tea that we like and ensure that they provide it in our suite, even though it is not usually on their menu.

The food in the Felix Restaurant is exceptional and the view is stunning. David Hajjar does a fantastic job of personalising the service offered here.

High Tea is a must at The Peninsula too.

Can not recommend this hotel enough."
347,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Best Hotel in the World,No doubt this is the best hotel in the world. I went win my honeymoon and they gave us an upgrade. The room was amazing and the service even better. The have all the details managed just thinking in how to make your stay more pleasant. Breakfast there had a variety of food for all palates.
348,Date of stay: June 2018,40,Restaurants,"I will say Peninsula hotel is one of the best hotels in Hong Kong. It decoration is classic and the atmosphere within is impeccable.

The bar on the 2nd floor is nice and cosy. I recommend going there for a drink after work.

The buffet dinner is nice but a bit expensive."
349,Date of stay: June 2018,50,Great hotel. Lots of History,"Located right on Tsim Tsat Shui, the peninsula stands out Majestically. One of the finest if not the best hotel in Hongkong. A stones throw away from the harbour. The hotels boasts of high end clientiele and it delivers."
350,Date of stay: June 2018,50,FIVE STAR LUXURY X’s 5 in Hong Kong,"After touring through China, I’ve stayed at many quality Hotels including Shangri - La, Waldorf and Four Seasons.

Although all of these brands were excellent, The Peninsula Hong Kong is simply in an entirely different category.

Perhaps it has to do with the impeccable condition of this property considering the fact that this is the original location built back in the 1920’s.

The rooms feature the best technology I’ve seen in a hotel room,......EVER!

The attention to detail and amenities in the rooms are excellent. The beds are incredible.

The lobby restaurant is excellent and features old school service great in a pleasant and rich environment.

The breakfast buffet is a incredible. Not sure what they put in their egg mixture, but it was the best omelette I’ve ever tasted.

Not only is the hotel itself incredible, but the views of Kowloon Bay and the Hong Kong skyline are breathtaking.

If you desire luxury in Hong Kong, look no further than The Peninsula Hotel."
351,Date of stay: June 2018,50,Excellence service but can be warmer,"First of all, it’s a fantastic hotel and the team is really professional...
I did not have any problem which is amazing with a complicated family as mine
The room, the all facilities and even the F&B are really as a luxurious 5 Star level

Second of all, as this hotel is reaching the top quality level it could be improved by a warmer team or a more “generous” team...

But nothing is perfect

Thanks for this fantastic “séjour” in this amazing hotel"
352,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Birthday stay,"I enjoyed a birthday break at the Peninsula as a special treat recently. The rooms were lovely and comfortable, with everything you need, though small by newer hotel standards. The staff were wonderful and the public areas are very beautiful.
We enjoyed swimming in the lovely pool and checking the early morning view of the harbour and island from the terrace outside.The hotel is a great location to walk to the ferry terminal, or catch the MTR. The breakfasts at The Verandah were excellent and eating a Felix gave us a wonderful night time harbour view!"
353,Date of stay: June 2018,50,What a treat!,A beautiful historic grand hotel in a fabulous location. Step back in time to amazing service and hospitality. A very special thank you to Cebestian at front desk who checked us in and continued to welcome us back each day by name including walking us to the door on departure to wish us a safe return home. I’m sure he will be manager of a Peninsula Hotel one day soon. Breakfast was fantastic and dinner in the restaurants were also perfect. We thought what a lovely hotel for a honeymoon if visiting HK. Thank you to all the staff who made our stay in HK so special.
354,Date of stay: June 2018,50,old school 5 star elegance,"a true 5 star hotel experience - a beautiful old hotel, modernised tastefully, with terrific service, centrally located in Tsim Sha Tsui. Highlights were the magnificent breakfasts and the degustation menu with wine pairings at Spring Moon (one of their several restaurants). didn't use the Rolls Royce transfers but probably should have !"
355,Date of stay: May 2018,50,Excellent afternoon tea at the Peninsula.,"This is an amazing hotel! The afternoon tea is very good with a large choice of delights. There is also a music band which creates a relaxing ambiance. The staff is really good and friendly. If you stay in Hong Kong, do not miss the afternoon tea at the Peninsula!"
356,Date of stay: November 2017,40,Luxury central location,"Location location location!
The Peninsula hotels always get the best locations. It’s the best location for tourists. The hotel is by Victoria Harbor, and some rooms like mine look out at the harbor, make sure you book a room with that view, it’s worth every penny. Views of the other side of the city was spectacular night and day.
The hotel is steps away from the Star Ferry and waterfront is a nice place to walk around. The hotel is always busy and afternoon tea is really popular there’s always a queue!"
357,Date of stay: May 2018,50,The Grand Old Lady of Hong Kong. Indubitably the Best.,"What a great pleasure it is to stay here, timeless elegance and service beyond compare.
Our room was luxurious and quiet,
Hotel facilities were excellent from the gorgeous breakfast to the best dinner buffet in the Verandah Restaurant I have ever eaten (mind you it should be at HK$2022 for 2 with very modest drinks at $223.
One bad design fault... Rest Rooms up one floor! I tripped on the stairs coming down and fell in a heap on the marble floor. Needless to say two hotel staffers appeared by magic and restored my shocked equilibrium.
Afternoon Tea was also a joy and an easy way of using up time before a late flight home from the airport. $756 for 2.
Certainly one of my top 10 hotels of all time."
358,Date of stay: May 2018,50,5 stars are not enough,"It was exactly what I expected.
High standard, awesome staff, amazing location. Everything perfect.
It is totally worth the visit. Probably one of the best views of Hong Kong, as the hotel is on the Kowloon peninsula, right in front of the famous Star Ferry pier, just a few minutes ride to the city.
I will be back!"
359,Date of stay: May 2018,50,Lives up to its legendary reputation,"Hong Kong's most famous hotel is not only living up to its reputation, but is adapting with the times to make sure that staying here is also a luxury 21st century experience.

As one would expect the public areas and restaurants etc at The Peninsula are grand and impressive, and the rooms are not just elegant but probably the best appointed I have even seen in a hotel - absolutely everything one would need is available in the room for no charge, inc. a TV system including tens of current movies free-to-view, a large Nespresso coffee and tea maker, large storage space for your clothes, ample plugs/power points, bottles of hand sanitzer in the bathrooms, TV and digital radio in the bathroom (with controls by the door and by the bath), etc, etc.

And the rooms have the most extensive and effective integration of technology I have yet had the pleasure to use in a hotel. I have stayed now in many, many hotels that have a hotel services tablet in the room, but they tend to be quite gimicky or don't work: but at The Peninsula there is a fully integrated system (with three tablets to use) that operate every single function in the room from the various lights and the air con to opening the curtains to changing TV channels to putting the do not disturb signs on and off. And with the press of a button fresh bottles of water are delivered to your room in less than 15 minutes.

Service is super-quick and extremely professional, and always goes the extra mile - when for example the hotel car that took me to the airport it did not just drop me off, but instead another staff member was there to take my bag for me to the check-in desk.

And the pool and leisure facilities are stunning and excellent - all designed in a grand Roman baths style.

So the stay was as good as it gets, and I hope to be able to return soon to The Peninsula."
360,Date of stay: November 2017,40,A real luxurious experience,"It was our first visit to Hong king and this hotel was long awaited. We booked the rolls Royce to collect us from the hotel and we were picked up and driven in style to the hotel. On arrival, the hotel was imposing and it was clear it was a destination place - tourists were queuing for the lobby bar. We checked into reception were taken to our deluxe room with views of the harbour - it was stunning. We stayed for three days and really enjoyed it. In particular we tried the spa and had made appointments before we arrived- it was superb - also there were so many restaurants of choice within the hotel it was fabulous. We also went to the indoor pool and sat out on the terrace watching the numerous helicopters landing on the roof bringing in new guests! The hotel is clearly iconic and if there is one fault it is you get lost in the busy tourist attraction that it is - felt impersonal as even checking in- we had to wait in a queue. However great location - great room and really enjoyed it"
361,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Consistency since then,"Service has never changed. They are so consistent with their service and standards. When we stepped in, I recalled my childhood days because it was how exactly they warmly greeted us and assisted us with our check-in. Their polite courtesy in outstanding.

Place is really recommended as it caters to most of what you need to see as you travel along here in this awesome place."
362,Date of stay: May 2018,50,Hong Kong business trip,"This hotel surprised me .
Professionalism and real quality more photos and videos will follow .
The indoor pool with underwater music , the SPA and the coffeetearia ( that’s how it is in Asia ) of a very high standard ."
363,Date of stay: May 2018,50,The Rolls Royce transfer is a MUST! Great location.,"Stayed here 10th to 15th May 2018. Room 2209. Grand Deluxe with harbour view. Booked the RR transfer from the airport. It was more than a transfer, it was a whole arrivals process. Met at aircraft door and escorted through all the arrival processes and to the waiting RR. Was a Perfect arrival experience.
In room checking was quick and efficient. Room was beautiful and very well equipped. View of the harbour was breathtaking.
In room facilities are too numerous to mention other than to say that nothing is forgotten and I cannot think of anything that I though would have been a nice to have.
The bathroom was marble and featured a bath and a seperate shower. The amenities were by Oscar de la Renta and felt very luxurious.
Breakfast was not included in my rate, even though it was 700 euro per night. Breakfast costs 43 euros. It is a grand affair in a beautiful room. Service of course was excellent. Choice very wide.
I used the swimming pool every day. It is on level eight and is large, and cooling after a morning in the city. It is indoors but on hot days there are tri folding doors that open up a whole wall to the open air. There are also steps onto an outdoor relaxation area. Service again was excellent. lots of towels, relaxing chairs, poolside slippers. There is a pool menu for food and beverages. Cold water and refreshing towels are free and readily available.
I had one 'odd' moment. On one of the days the person I was travelling with (room 2203) needed to come in from the street to fetch something from his room. I waited at a table in the entrance foyer. I was asked very politely by 2 people if i needed anything. The third person who approached me said 'Do you want something or are you just hanging around?' What???? By the time I had said I was waiting for someone she flounced off. I wanted to say how offensive I found her attitude and words quite offensive. I am still offended. I wish I d talked to someone about it but the person came back from his room and we left the hotel. This is my only negative on what was a wonderful stay at this beautiful hotel."
364,Date of stay: April 2018,50,What can I say... Magnificent,"My husband and I had the good fortune of staying at the grande dame in HongKong for four nights, prior to joining a cruise.
This hotel has old world colonial charm combined with cutting edge technology and sophistication.
The foyer, where you can sip tea or a cocktail, has its quartet playing the old time classics and the staff are almost invisible, quiet and attentive and always there when needed.
Attention to detail is such as decor, silverware flower arrangements are both exceptional and exquisite.
The buffet breakfast was outstanding. Individual chefs on each station and a special rice congee cook and egg chef to serve your choice freshly and hot. Plates are warmed and tea, boiling water, milk and sugar are served in elegant silverware.
The bathrooms in the suites are large and have 2 sinks, a large bath and separate shower and toilet with luxurious toiletries. The writing desk even has a printer in the drawer. Fresh fruit is left in the room each day, which adds a lovely touch.
The Peninsula makes the guest feel special and pampered, but at the same time as if it is natural and unpretentious.
It’s what not said that comes to my attention. Old world refinement and charm that is so rare in this day and age.
I will return in a heartbeat."
365,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Great Experience!,"This was a bucket list check box for me. I had always heard about the Peninsula HK and It did not disappoint. Beautiful iconic hotel in a great location of Kowloon. I recommend booking the hotel car service. Upon arrival from a long flight from Dubai, there was an attendant waiting for us when we got off the plane and onto a cart and quickly thru immigration, then out to a driver and off to the hotel. That was smooth and worth every penny. Arriving to the hotel, Riu the Guest Relations Agent was waiting to greet us and took us right up to the room by-passing the front desk. The personal service was wonderful and made check in easy (at the room) which was very nice. The rooms are beautiful and well kept, efficient and elegant decor. Breakfast was included in our rate and they did a great job assisting with dietary concerns without any problems. Afternoon tea service in the lobby was a lot of fun, just had to do it to partake in the classic old world ritual. Keep in mind this is an iconic hotel and can be very busy with locals, weddings, tourist etc. It's a big hotel and a landmark so the lobby area can get pretty chaotic...kind of like HK in general.
; ) I will stay here again on next trip to HK.
Safe travels everyone!"
366,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Best location!,"Great hotel, best location in Hong Kong, 3 minutes walk from ferry, and 5mins from the nearest station, surrounded by shopping malls and great HK atmosphere. Enjoyed the view, I would highly recommend it!"
367,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Celebrate my husband’s 50th birthday,"We enjoyed a week of spectacular views of the Hong Kong city, Victoria Harbour and the mountains behind the glittering neon signs from our 17th floor room. Room is elegant, spacious with up to date mod cons. Delightful decor and fabulous service. On our first day we took a day tour and the guide worked at the hotel. We later caught up with her in the swooning surrounds of the lobby and had a morning coffee. Relaxation and rejuvenation. Highlight for my husband was being picked up in a green rolls Royce at the airport and transported to this historic hotel on his birthday. As it was late we enjoyed fine in room dining. I have to admit the restaurant, Felix, where we feasted on the delights of the degustation menu, a few levels above our room, was my favourite memory of our time there. But there are also those breakfasts, the pool and spa facilities that are sensational to experience. I also enjoyed learning the history of the hotel that was playing on the tv at turndown. The hotel is significant and beautiful. The fragrant floral arrangements, amusing artworks and most importantly the welcoming, obliging staff. Thank you for a wonderful holiday to celebrate my husbands coming of age.😀❤️"
368,Date of stay: May 2018,50,Amazing,"We visited here for a buffet dinner. The hotel is easy to get to, and very beautiful.
The service is second to none, and the selection of foods available was really good. I can not recommend visiting highly enough.
Everything we tried tasted beautiful, and as I mentioned the selection was just great, we tried as much as we could, but eyes hungry than stomach I’m afraid.
The dessert station was fantastic as was the raspberry soufflé."
369,Date of stay: May 2018,40,Enjoyable Brunch.............,"We dropped into this iconic hotel and enjoyed brunch whilst we took in the atmosphere of this world famous hotel.

Whilst a little on the expensive side, it was worth the cost as we took in the ambiance and style of the magnificent design of the ground floor. The service was five star all the way and it was a joy to be able to relax and have a meal in a fuss free environment.

Well worth a visit if in Hong Kong and it is highly recommended for a very unique experience."
370,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Wonderful!,"Stayed there because of a fantastic room rate! (I am assuming that the price I paid was not the normal room rate)
What can one say, all luxury hotels should be modelled on this establishment!
No complaints really, but me being really picky. The food was pricey; but very good!
Wish I had the money to stay there more often.
If you get the chance, stay at this fantastic hotel!!!!"
371,Date of stay: April 2018,50,"Short trip to Hong Kong, enjoying the Peninsula very much","I did stay in the Peninsula in Bangkok and Manila before so when we planned to go to Hong Kong we decided to test the Peninsula there too. We didn't regret our decision.

The hotel is very close to the subway and ferry station from where you can reach any point in Hong Kong. It is next to the sea with a great view of the harbour and Hong Kong Island. However only if you are on a higher floor. They build something new between the harbour and the hotel. Not that high but removes the nice view on the lower rooms.
I experienced all the staff as super friendly and attentive.

The hotel rooms have all the features you need and more. Fresh fruits and water everyday. 3 tablets in the room to control music, lights, tv, aircon, etc. plenty of space for storage.
I loved the breakfast buffet even it was with around 50 USD rather expensive.

I also enjoyed the pool and spa area. The terrace has also a lovley view of the harbour and Hong Kong Island."
372,Date of stay: March 2018,50,One of my favourite hotels,"When you stay at the Peninsula Hotel you can be assured that it will be fantastic. Set in a beautiful historic building this hotel is the pinnacle of classic luxury. The staff are incredible and the restaurants are amazing. Make sure you book a room with the Hong Kong view, it is worth it"
373,Date of stay: April 2018,50,What a fantastic afternoon tea,"We were in Hong Kong, four adults and booked afternoon tea in the Peninsula. They could provide a Gluten free afternoon tea as well as a vegetarian afternoon tea.
We started off with a glass of champagne then cakes and sandwiches with plenty of choice of drinking teas. The Peninsula has a dress code as you would expect and even though you have to book, you'll queue and wait to be seated.

This was a fantastic experience in a great building and lovely atmosphere."
374,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Traditional luxury,"Peninsula is a real grand dame of Hong Kong and my favorite place to stay in Kowloon. Easy accessible to the shopping malls but it’s getting too crowded over the weekends.

Don’t forget to treat yourself with the best afternoon tea in city. Vivien was extremely helpful and took a great care of my family."
375,Date of stay: April 2018,40,2 nights in hong kong,"Stayed at this hotel with friends before boarding a cruise at the Ocean terminal. Reception and all staff very friendly and efficient. The deluxe room was excellent as was the indoor swimming pool. The restaurant food was not extraordinary but was very expensive. I would recommend going outside to eat, lots of restaurants in the vicinity"
376,Date of stay: October 2017,50,What an Icon,"The Peninsula Hong Kong belongs to an real benchmark for HongKong. The Spa and swimming area are fantastic also with its views over the Hongkong Harbour.

The Location is perfect for a short trip to the best luxury stores in Asia nearby"
377,Date of stay: September 2017,50,Simply one of the best hotels in the world,"Start with the Peninsula green Rolls Royce that picks you up at the airport (if ordered), then the high tech gadgetry in the opulent room, the absolutely stunning view from the rooftop spa and pool area, and afternoon tea which you can get in front of the throngs of people waiting since you are staying in the hotel. This hotel didn't disappoint at any point and it is very clear why it is the BEST place to stay in Hong Kong."
378,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Love this hotel!!,The Peninsula Hotel continues to impress me. I really enjoyed my stay here last year but was even more impressed the second time around. The rooms are clean and comfortable- I love the iPad that controls the entire room!
379,Date of stay: April 2018,50,From Airport to check out......Fabulous,"The Airport concierge met us as we disembarked from our Flight at HK International. A speedy transfer through the Airport & Immigration to be handed over to our Penn Driver, Sue, who was most professional.

We were booked into a Deluxe Room (2506)...a high floor but not a good outlook at the back of the Hotel....tip: when booking here request odd no. Rooms for a Harbour view,

The Room had every hi tech amenity necessary eg Control pads for every electrical item such Blinds, lighting, tv, aircon etc.

The Room facilities were, beyond expectations. A Nail Dryer?
And other extras.

The Location is superb taking only a few minutes to walk to the Harbour for the Star Ferry, Ocean Terminal for Cruise Ships and ideally located to walk into the Luxury Shopping area.

The Restaurants for breakfast were also excellent although we preferred the 1st floor Restaurant for both Buffet & A’ la Carte.

The Felix bar & Restaurant on the Top floor offers stunning views of the Harbour.

A stunning Hotel that delivered beyond our expectations."
380,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Just the best,"Second visit and they always deliver. Great rooms, super service, all the restaurants are good and the bar is quite special. Best place to stay in Hong Kong, close to everything. Try the limousine service, it’s awesome."
381,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Spectacular & Special Hotel,As seasoned luxury travelers we thought we saw everything. This hotel blew us away firstly for the incredible views but then for its location above a very high end and sizable shopping mall plus its extremely comfortable and high tech room plus the fabulous food. We would stay there again when we return to Hong Kong over the Peninsula where we had previously stayed several times. To us looking at Hong Kong Island from Kowloon is better than being there anyway.
382,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Pure luxury,"Extremely happy with my 2 night stay with my wife in march 2018. Many small little things this hotel has wich are unique, that make the stay even more memorable. Just a pure five star experience, and totally worth the money.
Very happy! I preferred being in Kowloon. Much more authentic. The boat ride over to Hong Kong island is very quick (5-7 minutes) and easy.

Stayed in a room with views over Hong Kong Island - very big windows. Perfect check-in and check-out experience.

I took the Rolls Royce pick-up from the airport wich was immaculate. Maybe a bit pricey, but surely worth it. Very professional in every aspect."
383,Date of stay: March 2018,30,Average room and poor concierge service,"Peninsular Hong Kong was always one of my favorite Hotels however my stay in March was disappointing , as a regular guest over the last few years I am normally offered an upgrade , this stay I was offered a very average room overlooking the back of the Hotel , which is not a very nice view , Concierge service was also not up to standard with staff quite rude and not helpful , unfortunately I will be going back to my other favourite Hotel Intercontinental where I always stayed before Peninsula with beautiful views over the Harbour and great Concierge Service , Danny"
384,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Incomparable,"Read this review in conjunction with my review of the Ritz-Carlton, to decide where to stay, depending on the vibe you would like to get on your visit to Hong Kong (iconic vs. futuristic). This review is strictly about the Peninsula, not the comparison.

This landmark hotel combines the best of the traditional (people have queued up for afternoon tea for almost a century) with some amazing in-room technology, a feature of Peninsulas everywhere. There is also a mind-boggling amount of swag, so much that I had to check baggage going home.

But it's really the service that makes The Peninsula stand out in a city known for high service standards. They somehow remembered that I really liked their chocolates (take a large number home with you--some of the world's best) and outfitted my room with both extra chocolates and a statue of the Peninsula's signature bellhop icon. I didn't even realize this was edible the first day I was there. They also remembered that I like to bring home tea bags for my wife, who says it's the best tea anywhere, so they outfitted my room with extra tea bags.

And this last trip I was one of ""those people"" who are always causing trouble with special requests. This time my cash cards weren't working (still don't know why) and they went out of their way to equip me with some cash, even though it was their policy not to get involved in that type of transaction.

I'm really at a loss for superlatives, other than to say that this is one of the world's best hotels and no one ever died wishing they had spent one less night at the Hong Kong Peninsula."
385,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Business gathering,"We met in the lobby of this great old same of a classic hotel for a formal business gathering and were lead up to the upper floors via the main lift to take a further smaller lift to the Heli-services area.

Amazing hotel that bursts with wealth charm and colonial grace. Don't miss a visit."
386,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Superior hotel with appropriate price,"One of the best HK impressions. The hotel has specialities like fleet of customized rolls Royce’s excellent food and well skilled stuff. Good selections of shops and great harbor view. If you ready to spend money for your hotel in hk, do it here"
387,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Ultimate Luxury,"Once in a while one returns to this iconic landmark hotel of Hong Kong and this was what I just did after a lapse of perhaps 3 years, and they still have my details on record. Indeed there are plenty of luxury hotels in Hong Kong but then there is only one Peninsula. Behind historic facades you have one of the most modern high tech rooms of the world, perhaps the undisputed No. 1 I have ever stayed in terms of provided facilities in the room, not only every thing you expect from a luxury hotel but also extra curiosity such as a nail-dryer for the lady. Each room has a separate desk (with printer/fax/full complement of stationary) for him and a dressing table for her. Fast wifi and multi-channel huge TV. There is even a TV at the bath tub. Cannot think of anything more one may need. In a word, one of the best hotels of the world, at a price of course but well-worth it for the affluent and for occasional indulgence for as commoner."
388,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Return to HKG,"Spent 7 months in HKG in 1991 whilst backpacking around Asia , and vowed to return for our 25th wedding anniversary and always wanted to spend some time at the peninsula.

It is just wonderful the service and attention to detail are perfect , we stayed in a harbour room view suite which offers nice views of the harbour and nightly light show .

Highly recommended."
389,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Iconic,"We stayed 3 nights in the Peninsula hotel as part of a trip to Hong Kong and Singapore
We had booked the Rolls Royce transfer and after having been met off our flight from London, escorted through immigration and our luggage collected it was a fabulous start to our trip to travel in the green rolls that have featured in so many films and travel programmes
Our first taste of the luxury the HK Peninsula has to offer
We had booked a deluxe harbour view room and whilst expensive, with floor to ceiling glass windows and amazing views over the harbour, it is worth every penny
I spent hours just watching the harbour traffic and the early morning sunrise.
The rooms are not particularly large and are probably the most expensive hotel rooms in HK but this is a iconic hotel with the most amazing staff who cater to your every need
From the pool attendant who came up with off the menu suggestions for lunch when nothing appealed, to the terrace staff who anticipated when there was a need for a parasol because the sun was getting too hot
Breakfast in Le Lobby was lovely with a great selection of fruits, juices and pastries as well as hot dishes to order. It was entertaining sitting there watching the coming and goings.
The only let down was that there is no lounge area on the ground floor, only two tall wooden chairs
And if you want afternoon tea you need to book, you cannot assume as a resident you will get a table. It is a real tourist magnet with queues out of the door
The hotel has a great selection of restaurants from Cantonese to Swiss to French and the Veranda which is a fabulous European mixed buffet which warrants a separate review
I cannot recommend the HK Peninsula highly enough. It is everything you expect it to be and more
An amazing experience"
390,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Fantastic Easter Break- without doubt the best luxury hotel experience we have enjoyed,"From being greeted at the airport gate with a buggy, quickly passing through customs to the awaiting RR Peninsula Green Phantom we were very impressed with the attention to detail and hospitality extended. Henry took us to suite 446 where a healthy breakfast was provided with the hotels compliments and then invited us to participate in the Easter egg painting which Imogen and Montgomery were very excited about. The room was superb with the most comfortable beds and state of the art electronic everything. Thank you to all the professional and attentive staff at the Peninsula Hotel who made this a memorable stay."
391,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Superb,"One of the Grande Dames of hotels. Nothing better in HK bar none.
Only wonderful things to say... superb service, great rooms, and excellent food.Spa is outstanding as well.... spacious and accommodating.

The only place to stay in Kowloon."
392,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Impeccable service,"This was our second visit to The Penninsula. Our first stay was pretty perfect, but this time seemed even more enjoyable. The views from our high floor room over the harbour were fantastic, we spent a lot of time admiring the ever changing scene ,day and night. The staff are excellent ,all knowledgeable, helpful and unobtrusive. Our room was serviced twice a day to a very high standard, though we never saw anyone doing it. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the room had everything we needed and more. AC, curtains and lighting all controlled by an iPad by the bed. Afternoon tea was as delightful as we remembered, good to book it, but think the staff may always be able to find a table for residents.Other than afternoon tea we only had breakfast in the hotel, it was plentiful with very nice fruit and bakery goods,good coffee too. The lady at the egg station always managed to remember what you had the day before! Omelettes were excellent.
A lovely historic hotel which manages to feel very small and personal,in an unbeatable position. Hope we will return one day!"
393,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Amazing hotel,"The service was second to none. We felt very special. The VIP pick up service from airport in Rolls Royce was worth every penny for a special experience. If you can stretch to it there is also helicopter transfers and scenic flights from hotel.
Afternoon tea is very popular so if you are staying in hotel, book your place to save queuing.
Room was spacious, clean and comfortable.
Swimming pool and gym were great. Large pool with deck with loungers and tables for breakfast or drinks."
394,Date of stay: April 2018,50,Treat yourself to the Best,"In addition the beautiful historic lobby , the wonderful ipad control for the lights, service and temperature the staff is among the best I have seen in more than 150 countries. They are superbly trained in customer service and reflect the special family values of the family owned Peniinsula Hotels.
Mateo Gonzalez, Assistant Front office manager deserves special mention for his ability to upgrade our room, which was part of the American Express platinum program.
The Superior harbor view suite was as good or better than you will find anywhere, The view was spectacular, the layout extremely well done and the space gracious. I loved the labels on the doors and drawers for everything from the hair dryer to the nail dryer.
Special mention also goes to Nicolas DuPont at the front desk and Brian Faul Chief Concierge for their helpful suggestions on how to go to Shenzhen on your own among other things.

We were so pleased with the food we ate all our meals there..There is even a Swiss restaurant with fondue as well as an extraordinarily sumptuous buffet dinner among others.

We chose to include breakfast in our package and the buffet was excellent. The croissants were perfect and the real maple syrup on the waffles especially good.The smoked salmon was high quality and plentiful."
395,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Exceptional service,"By far the best hotel I have ever stayed at. The room is well appointed and well equipped. The staff is well trained. At check in I informed the front desk that when we check out in three days, we want to leave two pieces of luggage for. Them to store and we will return after our trip to Macau and claim them. At check out, we called for luggage assistance, the bellman inquired which two pieces of luggage to be stored in the hotel without us mentioning it. I am so impressed. All the restaurants have excellent food and exceptional service to boot."
396,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Stunning,"From start to finish, this is an amazing hotel. From a VIP service through immigration, to the most beautiful lobby, to great views, to an amazing breakfast buffet, everything is picture perfect. Worth every penny."
397,Date of stay: March 2018,50,A Magical Experience!,"If you want to be treated like royalty, stay at the Peninsula Hong Kong! From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed and made to feel special. The room was spacious and fantastic with both charming and high tech appointments. The staff was always helpful, and they sent a lovely surprise for my husband’s birthday, too.

The buffet breakfast was elegant, yet comfortable, and absolutely extraordinary.

It’s the only place to stay in Hong Kong."
398,Date of stay: April 2017,50,The FlagShip of The Peninsula Hotels,"This was a fantastic Birthday Surprise as I landed there late afternoon on my birthday all the way from the East Coast of USA! By the time I entered my quarters, the very observant front desk associate already had arranged the bespoke birthday cake and soft ambiance lights!! I was very moved also by their impeccability in organizing my sudden last moment travels to Beijing the following day! Top of the line place and team -as some of us know- that implies Worldwide!"
399,Date of stay: March 2018,50,A nearly perfect stay,"Was in Hong Kong for Art Basel and though many wanted to stay near the Convention Center, I would stay nowhere else.

The views from the room are phenomenal. The service is impeccable. It's everything a luxury hotel should be. Love the Peninsula brand and that once you've stayed at one, they all have the same systems so it's easy to acclimate. And the valet box is such an advantage. Busy getting ready and waiting for someone to come knock and fetch your laundry is so yesterday!

Gym was great. Machines in perfect condition.

Breakfast each morning was delicious and enjoyable.

One complaint, my printer didn't work. Housekeeping couldn't fix. Supervisor was called but never showed. The business center was locked [midday - very odd]. But, being the Peninsula, the front desk stepped in immediately and printed what I needed for my meeting and all was made right.

Left indecent reviews for Felix and the Bar....both were great. Yes, some nights you want to go out and experience the city. But sometimes, having several fantastic options to stay in are most welcome.

Also, forgot to pack my loafers and having the shopping arcade saved me!"
400,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Utter bliss,I have been lucky enough to have stayed at this grand hotel on three occasions. However this last stay was for 12 nights quite a long stay. We choose to spoil ourselves completely so had the Rools Royce meet us this entailed a man meeting us at the gate upon our arrival taking care of our hand luggage ushering us through the fast lane immigration collecting our luggage and delivering us to our Rolls Royce driver. After a very smooth ride we were met at the entrance to the peninsula by a lovely young lady who took us to our room and checked us in. A bowl of fruit and some delicious chocolates awaited us followed by a man with tea. The whole experience was luxurious I must say since my last stay a long time ago some small economic changes have occurred such as the rooms when refurbished are much smaller and similar small cutbacks but nothing detracts from the overall grandeur
401,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Great location and amazing service.,The Peninsula Hong Kong is conveniently located with amazing views. The service was great. The breakfast buffet every morning had a wide variety of foods. There is a bar with great views and both the men and women's bathrooms are a must to visit while there.
402,Date of stay: March 2018,40,Lovely hotel,"I really enjoyed staying at this hotel. The rooms were nicely designed and well equipped. Loved the mirror that popped up on the desk to dry your hair, all the charging cables, the board for my hair straightener and the universal remote control from the large iPad like screen to dim lights, open blinds, adjust room temperature etc.. Also you can leave your shoes to be cleaned which was a nice touch. My dining experiences weren't as great though. High tea and breakfast in the lobby were both extremely slow with numerous mistakes including not getting our tea with high tea despite being there for over an hour."
403,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Grand Hotel Peninsula HK,The level of your stay is in the details. The don’t leave details to chance at the HK Peninsula they are always doing there utmost to please there guests. There concierge team is the best I’ve ever encountered amazing. Wonderful and tasteful breakfast buffet with worldly flavours. The “Bar” was class all by itself top shelf. Thank you to the team at the Peninsula for helping imbed such a pleasant memory of Hong Kong.
404,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Great Hotel,"Loved this hotel, too many highlights to mention. 5 star service included everything from shoe shine to Rolls Royce pickup from the airport. Great swimming pool and workout facilities. Awesome partnership with American Express and terrific staff with attention to detail."
405,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Brilliantly planned details,"Gorgeous, elegant hotel reminiscent of colonial times. The rooms are more thought out than any hotel room that I have ever encountered. The entire room is operated by an IPAD- that actually works!! The lights are operated not by a regular switch but by a dimming touch pad on the walls. If you want to have your clothes cleaned you put the clothes in a chute which has access to the hallway and when you press the valet button, someone arrives and takes the clothes out of the hamper from the hallway. Such a cool detail. The rooms are accented with gorgeous dark wood. The showers are excellent and the bathrooms have dual sinks. These are just some of the details. Truly enjoyed this hotel."
406,Date of stay: March 2018,40,The little things...,"Number 1: It's a Peninsula. So service is great. Number 2: It's located where it's located: Can't beat the location if you don't want to be on the island side. It's a fun spot and makes for a difference experience of HK vs. staying on the island. If you get a new room in the tower overlooking the HK skyline, you'll be happy. If you end up in a room on the lower floors with stains on the carpet, etc. -- doesn't make for a 5-star experience. I'm actually shocked that they would give anyone a room with major stains on the carpet. So... it'll come down to the room you get. We reserved the Rolls Royce pick-up -- great experience from the gate to the hotel. Just be aware: The car is perhaps good for three people in the back... if you're four... sitting in the front just doesn't make for the same experience and I recommend against booking the RR as soon as someone has to sit in the front. On the way back we did their van service: Excellent. Good ride. A rep waited for us at the airport and helped us with the luggage, check-in, etc. -- worth it. So, all great... if you, Peninsula, would only make sure your carpets are clean."
407,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Rosie,"My friends and I returned twice for afternoon tea thanks to the superb service we received from the waiter Loui on our first visit. He was kind, courteous and excellent at his job, nothing was too much trouble and he made our visits memorable events. On our final visit this afternoon we asked after Loui to be told he was on his break as he was scheduled to work an evening shift. After a few minutes he appeared and waited on us with his customary charm and attentiveness! All in all a credit to the magnificent Peninsula hotel."
408,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Hospitality Perfected,"My bride and I stayed at The Peninsula following our wedding, which was held at a different venue. Everything about our stay showed the consideration, expertise and service for which The Peninsula is known. The staff knew we would be exhausted after our wedding day and so arranged for us to be whisked straight from the hotel car to our room, where check in was completed. They had refreshments waiting for us their and we ordered excellent room service and relaxed. Various friends and family visited us during our stay (which was for two days before leaving Hong Kong) and we tried the Swiss restaurant and cocktail bar, both of which were excellent. My wife and I both travel extensively and have stayed in a great many hotels. We agreed afterwards that The Peninsula is the best we have experienced anywhere in the world. I cannot recommend it more strongly, and we have resolved to make it a tradition spend our anniversary there."
409,Date of stay: March 2018,40,"good, but far from perfect","We have just had stayed 5 days in 4 Seasons hotel in Koh Samui (Thailand) prior to stay in the Peninsula Hotel in HK. This probably did not help as I gave a 5 to the 4 Season (it was basically all perfect). I can’t say the same this time.
We enjoyed the room of course (+ the electronic controlers > nice and easy), the whisky bar at the 1st floor (nice atmosphere and nice cocktails) The rest was just slightly disappointing. Just small details that leave you with a vit taste of disappointment:
- we could not find where to use the hair dryer (no mirror near the plug or we just could not find it)
- the app on the tablet does not allow you to order daily food apart from the breakfast menu (you still need to call the operator). Also, you cannot order a simple black coffee on the app. 2 smoothies that were ordered were missed.
- The staff was friendly but a snip arrogant or complacent (you just had this feeling that you were annoying them, especially the concierges.
No big things, but detaisl that kind of ruin your overall impression when you set your expectation high.

Finally, we enjoyed the first star Michelin Chinese restaurant (on the first floor). We had a good time and the waiters were night. BUT, we just found the food tasteless. No way, we think this would deserve a 1Star Michelin in Europe.

Our conclusion: good, but far from perfect."
410,Date of stay: February 2018,50,A classy high-end hotel to stay in HK,"Beautiful hotel, it reminded me a bit of Taj Palace Mumbai, a more modern version,if possible pls do ask for a room with the view.

A lot of ppl were lining up for afternoon tea. If you can get a seat you shall experience that too.

Service is great."
411,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Immense,"It was my first visit to Hong Kong and we stayed at the formidable Peninsula Hotel.

Can definitely recommend the Rolls Royce transfer- met at the aircraft door driven in a buggy to immigration then escorted to the waiting Rolls Royce then on to the hotel where you are given in room check in. Our room was available at 7am and we were given late check out until 2pm.

The spa was a great area to relax, we sat outside with views over to Central.

The service was consistently high- every request we made was done in a timely manner.

We had the choice of breakfast in the lobby or Verandah. We tried both but preferred the lobby where you ordered a la carte and it is such a great place for people watching.

Our room was a standard category (deluxe) but there was nothing standard about the room. It had a spacious foyer with wardrobe, a separate toilet with wash basin, bathroom with separate shower and bath with dual sinks. The bedroom area had a sofa and desk in the seating area with plenty of space and twin beds as requested. There were 3 ipads in the room which controlled TV, curtains, lighting. HD movies were free."
412,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Everything you expect and more,"This hotel comes with certain expectations which it more than lives up to. The service is absolutely impeccable, the incredible quality of the food and the high-tech room with every comfort are all fabulous. On top of this the helpfulness of all the staff is remarkable. A particular mention must go to concierge who helped us with everything from a restaurant reservation to maps, suggestions and information.
Yes it is expensive but worth every penny."
413,Date of stay: March 2018,50,Golfing Holiday,"Stayed 4 nights at the Peninsula.

From checkin to checkout - only one word can describe this hotel ( fabulous service level). Everyone plays a part and everyone deserves the accolades and a pat on the shoulder for a job well done.

Most have describe about the rooms and therefore will not dwell too much on it. Like the high ceilings in the room (only feedback lack of clock or time except on the iPads - suggestion to place a small waterproof clock in the bathtub for those who love to soak longer in a bathtub)... Lovely!

Concierge:- kudos to Cissie and Kyris for their help in getting our dinner reservations at the 3 stars Michelin restaurants before our arrival. They also assisted in getting our transport arrangements to the Golf courses. Everything went about like clock work.

Front Desk:- Joey, helpful and cheerful on recommending nice local joints for our late supper.

Bell hop:- sorry did not get his name but the tall bespectacled gentleman was most helpful in arranging all our golf bags before and after our game.

Did not take advantage of any of the FnB outlets as our schedule was tight playing 3 days of Golf.

Will definitely return even if if it was just to sleep."
414,Date of stay: February 2018,30,"Expensive food, not worth it","Last month I visited the hotel lobby twice to get dinner. Based on my two experiences I can say that the food is overpriced for the portion served. Moreover, when I ordered soup, the bread they served it with was not fresh anymore. Food service is fast but to request other items in between meals I had to be really persistent to catch the waiter's attention."
415,Date of stay: April 2017,50,No other place like this ! Impossible !,"We were very lucky as we stayed at the Marco Polo Suite, and then, there, the world at our feet.
Stonishing views from Victoria Harbour,
Excelent Staff, professional and Kind
Service is perfect !
Linen so good.. peaceful dreaming
The suite had three wind sides of the building.
Rolls Royce service from the airport.
Breakfast excelent quality and service as well
All in all, unforgettable.
I have been at The Peninsula many times, and even the deluxe superior rooms are excelent !
Everything at the Peninsula is certainly unforgettable for the quality of excelence !"
416,Date of stay: November 2017,50,"Another one off the ""bucket list""","Always wanted to visit and stay at the Peninsula - remembered it as a child when lived in Hong Kong - it was the place to stay. Luxury at its finest - from the green rolls royce pick up at the airport to the amazing rooms/suite. And ""afternoon tea"" is the highlight of any visit to the Peninsula. Shame the weather didnt match the hotel. Highly recommended and would definately go back."
417,Date of stay: January 2018,50,"Exemplary hotel, faultless","It is not often you get to say that hotel exceeds expectations. The Pennisula in Hong Kong did just that for us. I don’t know if you’re like me, but, quite often with the price point of 5 star hotels you expect the best and for several reasons they miss the mark. This hotel doesn’t.

We arrived at the crack of dawn from our Manchester flight to Hong Kong and our room was available for us to check in at 8am - we couldn’t believe our luck. That was a wonderful benefit to us. Obviously you can’t always be that lucky; we were this time and we’re so grateful to the Pennisula for going the extra mile to get our room ready.

We were also granted a wonderful room on the second from highest floor of the hotel which was just fabulous for us. For the views of the helicopters and also the views over to Hong Kong island.

The breakfast buffet is delightful, the food and beverage staff work wonders. The service feels effortless and relaxing to watch.

You can even book a helicopter trip from the top of the hotel. We did that with the help of the concierge who were again exemplary to deal with. And went the extra mile to make sure that we were able to get on the flight before we left.

I would highly recommend getting the hotel to book your airport transfers.

Pre book dinner at the hotels restaurants weeks before you arrive as friends of ours couldn’t get in, as they hadn’t.

We absolutely loved the speak easy feel bar. Whilst we appreciate it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea; we felt right at home listening to the live music on the bar stools (which have backs) and eating about 394394 of the chilli chocolate covered almonds that they provide.

We can’t wait to return to this delightful hotel."
418,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Simply stunning,"If you‘re looking for a stupendous view, ideal location, impeccable service, elegant rooms, great breakfast buffet and an excellent spa, look no further!

The Japanese restaurant is outstanding; the other restaurants are merely good."
419,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Massage and reflexology,"Little hidden gem I wish I’d found earlier in our stay. Lovely massage and staff with satisfactory - good English skills. Reflexology was professional and explained throughout. Massage wasn’t the best I’ve ever had but still
Very nice. $348HK for two hours"
420,Date of stay: January 2018,50,Pleasant Stay,"The Peninsula is a spectacular hotel. The room was beautifully appointed. The room's many technology features were very easy to navigate. The bed was the most comfortable in which we have ever slept! We were also bowled over by the view of Hong Kong island across the harbour.
The buffet breakfast was superb with an amazing variety of food available."
421,Date of stay: February 2018,50,The Peninsula delivers again,"For decades The Peninsula (The Pen) has been a mandatory stop for me whenever I visit Hong Kong, because I cannot resist the old world charm of the place.

Earlier this month (Mon.12 Feb), I arranged to meet an associate for coffee and cake at The Pen. As I got delayed en route by almost an hour, I decided to treat my associate to lunch at The Lobby to make up for her long wait. We decided to go for the 3-course set lunch.

As expected from The Pen, each course was delicious and filling; however, what impressed me the most this time was not so much the food but the service. While I have always found the staff at The Pen to be unfailingly polite and efficient, they have also always seemed a little cold and up-tight--I ought to stress that this is not unique to The Pen. The young lady waiter who waited upon my table this time surprised me by her relaxed and helpful manner. She was was human, had a sense of humour, and nothing was too much trouble for her--she was simply outstanding.

I am one of those ""difficult"" customers with food allergies and health problems that I wish I did not have. And this young lady, whose name I regret not knowing, went the extra mile to ensure that I did not go hungry and that I had a good experience.

My salad arrived with the goat cheese served in a separate small dish; the sides for the beautifully cooked steak were replaced with safe substitutes; and the dessert was tweaked so that the banana ice-cream was replaced by a quenelle of raspberry sorbet.

The bill came to under HKD900, which is a steal for the experience, I think.

Thanks again to the nameless young lady waiter and to all the kitchen staff involved in making my latest visit so enjoyable. I now have another happy memory to add to my list of fond memories associated with The Pen."
422,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Absolute perfection,"Beautiful hotel with the right elements firmly in the traditional side of things with plenty of modern comforts. It's a home from home

Few recommendations if staying there

1. Go for a swim in the pool. Stunning views across Victoria Harbour. And it's not busy

2. Have afternoon tea in the main foyer.

3. Try the Chinese restaurant. The dim sum is world class!"
423,Date of stay: November 2017,40,"Beautiful, old school hotel",I was so looking forward to staying at this hotel after knowing about it for so long. It is indeed beautiful and the service is top notch. Because of the age of the building there are some things that can’t be fixed - ie parts of the breakfast room are quite dark - but I think it is liveable. The food is of the highest quality and the rooms incredibly comfortable and pleasant. I will definitely be back.
424,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Gorgeous,"Great location, courteous service, lovely foyer, gorgeous swimming pool, delicious breakfast.

We’ve been a few times to this beautiful hotel and cannot fault it. Love the view of the Chinese New Year fireworks from the terrace.

I hope The Peninsula stays the same for many years to come."
425,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Brilliant. This is how a hotel should operate.,"We stayed three nights at The Peninsular and from the moment you arrive until the moment you leave you feel that you are in a dream. Everything works like clockwork. The staff are fantastic and the facilities are second to none.

We were collected by the green Rolls Royce from the airport, and you are whisked through the terminals from your arrival gate to a separate limousine lounge ...how special.

I couldn't think of anything that we needed in the bedroom; simply everything had been thought of: multiple chargers in the bedside cabinet, an electrically operated vanity mirror in the dressing table and the most comfortable of beds.

The spa is heavenly, even if you do share the sauna with some Chinese on the phones! And when I mentioned to my therapist that it was birthday, I found chocolates waiting for me on my return to the room.

Breakfast is fantastic, even down to the lovely crispy bacon. What more could you need?"
426,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Where Service Reigns,"The Peninsula is the Grande Dame of Kowloon, but as venerable as she is, she still has a few tricks up her sleeve. Like the elaborate electrical system with touch controls everywhere. Like the push-button lighted make-up mirror that rises majestically out of a desk. Like conveniently-situated 110 electrical sockets and USB ports. Like profuse amenities. But the Peninsula's claim to fame is not just because of technology. It is in the smiling faces of staff members who rush to open a door, fetch a glass of orange juice from the breakfast buffet, assist an older couple to shortcut a long line a for a table for tea. These are the small courtesies that count and mean so much to travelers.

In addition, the breakfast buffet mentioned above is a feast for the eyes as well as the stomach and offers western fare as well as Chinese, Japanese and other exotic cuisines.

You will pay extra to stay at The Peninsula, but you will be pampered and cherished and you will find the experience is well worth the price."
427,Date of stay: January 2018,50,Style and luxury,"Perfect location, beautiful rooms, traditional decor, faultless service, one of the best places to eat Chinese food (if you want something that is not on the menu ask and they will cook if for you), wonderful place to have afternoon tea. One of my favourite swimming pools in the world. You will pay accordingly but if you have the money it is worth it. You can ask for transport to and from the airport by one of their Rolls Royces or even a helicopter. Personally I recommend train to Hong Kong island then, provided you do not have much luggage take the Star ferry."
428,Date of stay: August 2017,50,World-Class in every way,"We returned to the Peninsula for a second-Honeymoon fifteen years after we stayed there as newlyweds, and we were not disappointed. Impeccable service, first-class amenities (that incredible swimming pool!) terrific food & beverage, and an overall atmosphere that is both elegant and welcoming left us wishing we had planned an even longer stay.
Because our flight from New York was scheduled to arrive very early in Hong Kong - this was the first stop on our month-long visit to Asia - I wrote to the GM to inform him that (1) this was our second honeymoon (complete with the dates of our 2002 stay) and (2) that we planned to arriving very early, before the standard check-in time.
In return, I received a message saying that while the hotel could not guarantee early check-in, we would be able to change and relax in the gym and pool area if we arrived before our room was ready. In the end, the room was available for early check-in after all, complete with a special welcome in the form of a bowl of fruit, a welcome-note, the hotel's signature chocolates, and a pot of hot tea: the perfect ""welcome back"" after one such a long-haul journey.
Overall, everything about our stay at the Peninsula was wonderful, from the incomparable swimming pool to the in-room dining to the impeccable directions and instructions when we decided to take a last-minute visit to Macau, and the in-room dining when we returned from Macau too tired to seek dinner elsewhere. We wholeheartedly recommend the Peninsula Hong Kong, and look forward to our next visit."
429,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Luxurious beyond words,We had the pleasure to stay in a suite with an outstanding view of the city which is extra special at night with the colourful lights.. The room has labelled drawers and cupboards with everything you will need for a very comfortable stay. The bathroom has his and her sinks and you can soak in the bath whilst catching up with the news on the bathroom tv. The staff were helpful with every need especially when we needed a late checkout as our flight was 23.45. They transferred us to a luxury double room which had all the same amenities just not the view
430,Date of stay: February 2018,20,Opulence everywhere...but the Bar is a huge let down,This iconic hotel is spectacular in every way imaginable.....but seriously the Bar is a huge let down. After trudging through the streets of Hong Kong we were really looking forward to that special cocktail at the end of the afternoon. Now the cocktails are expertly crafted and served (and really overpriced) but the let down comes from the room. It is a windowless closet of a space which would offer a degree of intimacy if no one else shows up. But the shocker are the chairs....most uncomfortable and not befitting such a venue. Treat yourself at any of the other 5 star hotel lounges or better yet go to The Ozone Bar high a top the Sky 100 Bldg....fabulous bar and what a spectacular view.
431,Date of stay: February 2018,50,Breakfast at The Peninsula,"Lets face it, The Peninsula Hong Kong is just fabulous! Opulent, comfortable and stylish. Breakfast here is no exception.
Excellent service with a warm smile. The menu caters to all tastes and is generous. We love it."
432,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Chef's table for Lunch,"Absolutely amazing experience. It was a little strange to begin with, being taken through the beautiful Gaddi's restaurant and out the back where all the action is going on, then you see a lovely table set up with your names on the menu (which was chosen for us by chef). All courses were fabulous as was the tour and the staff. We went for wine pairings. I myself dont like sweet desert wine so the somalier brought a range out that I tried and still didnt like! Over all a fantastic experience. Small portions but left feeling full, very rich food. Staff amazing.Tour interesting."
433,Date of stay: January 2018,50,Amazing dinner,Just had a fabulous dinner at this hotel if you eat the set menu with wine it is £50 per head and is such good value for money everything about this was amazing including James the head waiter who was very informative and recommended lots of lovely things to do and see
434,Date of stay: November 2017,50,First Time Visit to Hong Kong,"Thoroughly enjoyed a 3-night stay at Peninsula HK. The classic hotel. Excellent in every way. Terrific harbor-view rooms, clean, quiet, laden with amenities. Comfortable place to return after a busy day of sightseeing. Staff were attentive throughout the stay. Particularly enjoyed high tea in the Lobby and the swimming pool with a view of the harbor. Treat yourself to a Rolls Royce transfer."
435,Date of stay: January 2018,50,One of the great city centre hotels of the world.,"A 4 night stay was a delight. Efficiency and professional attention at every step, everywhere. The suite was immaculate with wonderful Harbour views and every conceivable amenity. Impeccable room servicing twice daily, world class restaurants at reasonable prices for such high quality, and excellent breakfasts in two differently styled locations. When a luxury escape in Hong Kong is what you are looking for,I doubt whether there could possibly be a better hotel, conveniently located. And the carefully driven hotel limousine to the airport also included the nice touch of someone meeting us at the airport to escort us to the Qantas check-in. Yet another example of this Hotel catering for every little detail. In addition, The Spring Moon restaurant in particular, is a wonderful Cantonese restaurant of high quality. A memorable stay."
436,Date of stay: January 2018,50,The best hotel we have ever stayed in,"We spent 3 nights here and were blown away by the quality of the service and by the use of technology to bring th place right up to date. Yes it's expensive but for a few days it's worth every penny.

We loved it."
437,Date of stay: September 2017,50,Absolute superb,Well what can I say a absolute superb hotel and the food was out of this world . A very ultra modern hotel. Nothing was too much to ask from the staff . All controllers were done by a touchpad which I found easy to use . My wife really enjoyed the selection of a variety of food . A def stay
438,Date of stay: January 2018,50,Pricy but excellent hotel,"We stayed at the Peninsula Hotel for a few days and was very impressed by the high standard and quality of service. The rooms are equipped with the latest in technology, 3 iPad size touch screens control the room environment and more wall controlled touch screens control each room.

Breakfast caters for all tastes and eating preferences with a good selection of fresh fruits and salads.

The location is maybe not in the best part of HK but the MTR which incidentally is much faster to travel by than taxis is only a few minutes journey from anywhere.

If budget is not an issue, I would highly recommend the Peninsula"
439,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Paradise stay at the Peninsula HK,"The Peninsula Hong Kong is really the jewel in the crown. Every thing in this hotel is wonderful and perfect. My wife and I enjoyed tremendously. The room was very comfortable and elegant fully equipped. The breakfast was excellent and above all - the service by all staff.
Simple perfect."
440,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Incredible hotel to view nature of hongkong,"I am writing you about it to view the special sightseeing of hong kong by this hotel, Near to this their is a lot of lot of tourist hubs and unlimited shopping place too. you can have a great day there , also their is a clock tower too. so lets visit it."
441,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Fanatastic Hotel,"Well known historical hotel location is great for people watching, Rolls Royces parked outside, Here you see the elite of Hong Kong and the rest of the world. Was here at Christmas foyer had lovely choir of carol singers, beautiful Chrisatmas trees and decorations"
442,Date of stay: January 2018,50,The Best City Hotel possibly in the world,Fantastic Hotel the staff are some of the best I have ever experienced and a fantastic breakfast. Do the Helicopter trip over Hong Kong from the roof of the Hotel. Try and book a full Harbour View Room as well.
443,Date of stay: January 2018,40,Pretty amazing,Great to stay in a hotel with class and elegance as opposed to the multiple same looking modern designed places . Being picked up by Rolls Royce was a real treat . Service was impeccable . Breakfast restaurant could ha e more options and staff in that area could be a bit more cheery .
444,Date of stay: December 2017,50,The Very Best in Hong Kong,"Last year we had a fantastic 2016 countdown in Grand Hyatt Taiwan

This year we had the best countdown ever!!!

Thank you The Peninsula Hong Kong!!!

Although we got to a not so good start due to miscommunications that lead us to be without transfer from airport upon arrival but thereafter everything was WOW!

Sincere 'Thank You' to Chole and Marco, and the entire The Peninsula Staffs that give us a most memorable stay in Hong Kong. ( We are frequent visitor to HK)

This is THE place for New Year Eve Countdown. The best venue for your NYE Party, dinner and the fantastic view of NYE spectacular fireworks.

At Felix you can party, have fine dinner and fantastic view of Hong Kong Skyline and fireworks

If possible, go for Peninsula Culinary Journey that takes you to four of the hotel's best restaurants. Highly recommended

Our suite is spacious and comfortable. Fully control via smart panels. Complete ammenities and well stock mini bars.

Spring Moon, Michelin star restaurant, is highly recommended. Make sure you book in advance.

Hightea at The Lobby is also a must. Gaddis is not to be missed too.

Overall, The Peninsula Hong Kong,, excellent in every aspects."
445,Date of stay: January 2018,30,Like Staying in Disneyland on Holiday,"The title makes sense and you’ll see why. The property is super nice and well kept. However it’s super packed, since it’s a tourist destination, with visitors just looking to take pics but aren’t guests. Which makes it extremely uncomfortable to walk around, enter and exit or hail a cab. This is why the resemblance to Disneyland. This is a reason why I wouldn’t return. The other is that I encountered terribly rude staff in all the different areas. Oddly enough there is no middle ground because we also encountered the most attentive staff I a couple of occasions. The concierge in particular were terrible: snobby, stock up, unhelpful and rude."
446,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Amazing hotel,"This is a wonderful hotel! The room we had was really comfortable and luxurious, the staff were friendly and helpful and the breakfast was lovely. We had a courtyard room overlooking the front of the hotel so lots to see. The pool area was beautiful and relatively quiet so easy to get a sun bed.
Overall a highly recommended hotel."
447,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Great attention,"I have stayed at the Peninsula for both business and with family and can’t recommend it highly enough. The attention to detail is second to none and the staff are clearly there to serve, regardless of the request."
448,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Family Christmas,i would like to thank pinky Housekeeping and kumair to find my wife’s watch when we were rushing checking out of the hotel. We had big family event during the Christmas time and we had great time at the peninsula HK!
449,Date of stay: January 2018,50,Perfection has its name,"We stayed in Peninsula HKG for 5 nights. We have been to many luxury hotels in many countries, and Peninsula is one of our top favourite hotels! Very friendly and helpful staff, perfect service. We enjoyed also very much the pool area which is very clean. Last but not least: the New Year’s Eve at Felix restaurant was incredible!!! Best New Year’s Eve so far! Thank you Peninsula and congratulations for this level of perfections!"
450,Date of stay: December 2017,50,New Year's Eve lobby gala dinner,"Just celebrated New Year's Eve at The Peninsula Hotel. Important to stress it is a tiny ticketed special celebration event.

Good cocktail before dinner with live music on stage. Dinner was good, but service slight below their usual excellence probably due to a full attendance.

Excellent atmosphere throughout the evening. The band was spectacular and the show and music just before countdown created a very memorable way to welcome in 2018. The location of The Peninsula means you have good views of the fireworks over Victoria Harbour

Definitely not a cheap treat but as an end of year gala dinner in a top hotel in HK, it is ok priced.

One of those experiences that you would want to repeat or at least experience once in a lifetime."
451,Date of stay: December 2017,10,Horrible services and extremely rude front door staffs,"The worst doorman service that you could possibly imagined even at a three start hotel. On 30/12/2017, we visited the hotel for lunch. Upon our arrival, all the staffs were busily chatting that no one even bother to open taxi door for us -the first sign which showed how loose the service team was. When we were leaving, the front door staff asked us to line up. We were the first one in the line and the poor management has made us to wait for more 10 min for taxi. The worst part was when the taxi finally arrived, the staff falsely accused us for cutting the line. The funniest thing was, the man who they said he was in front of us, his wife was telling her husband to be civilized and not to cut our line. When our taxi driver couldn't understand English, and asked the staffs for assistance. The staff replied since we cut the line, we should dealt it ourself. It was simply unbelievable. However, how could you blame the staffs? Since they never paid attention to their customers, how would it be possible for them to know who was there first. All in all, horrible management and service quality at Peninsula, and your money deserves to be spent at better places."
452,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Top-notch Hong Kong,"You cannot stay in a better hotel in Hong Kong than the Peninsula. There are different hotels in different neighborhoods, there are bigger hotels, and there are more flashy hotels, but this one is hands-down the best that we have experienced in this wonderful town. Great location in Kowloon, great history, great staff, and magnificent facility...you will not be disappointed if you stay here--I gar-ron-taaaayy.!!"
453,Date of stay: March 2017,40,Didn't stay but walked around the public areas,"The public areas, lobby, dinning rooms etc looked very nice, has that elegant 1920's feel similar to Raffles in Singapore, the Majestic in Ho Chi Minh City and Metropole in Hanoi. Very high ceilings, grand staircase and ornate decorations."
454,Date of stay: December 2017,10,Poor service brings the Peninsula down,"The positives: My visit started off great with a Rolls Royce pickup with an awesome driver to boot.

The renovated rooms, which to me, were better than others in its class, like the FS HK, had a great balance of modern technology and tradition along with a beautifully designed interior.

The lobby with xmas decorations and live music created a lovely and festive holiday ambiance, although it can feel a bit crowded and busy with no sitting area for hotel guests and lines of outside tourists for the afternoon tea, as many have pointed out on Trip Advisor.

Sadly, after that, the Peninsula experience quickly went down hill for us.

The negatives: Waitstaff in the Lobby Lounge and Verandah were unprofessional, rude and inattentive.

Concierge, front door staff and operator were equally unfriendly and unhelpful.

There was a surprising consistency in the poor attitude toward customer service throughout the hotel.

For instance, when no one picked up at the Spa, my call was automatically transferred to the operator. I told her I was calling the spa but before I can finish my sentence, she said ok and transferred me back to the spa.

Of course no one picked up again and I was transferred back to the operator which was a waste of time and brought me back to square one.

This happened on a number of occasions where the same operator cut me off and was quick to transfer me elsewhere.

A properly trained operator at a hotel in this class, in my opinion, usually gives the customer a chance to finish speaking and then asks if they can transfer the call. It would give me the chance instead to ask if the Spa can call me back when they are free, etc.

Another example was the airport transfer upon checkout. Prior to my arrival, I requested a minivan with 2 baby car seats.

The hotel sent me multiple emails asking me for details like the age and weight of the two babies to get the right sized baby car seats.

When we got to the minivan, I only saw one baby car seat and they said all the other seats were at the airport. Shocking. What about safety? For a hotel so big on insurance, is this not an issue?

The biggest problem of our stay was that the toilet reeked of a terrible sewage smell.

I reckoned it had something to do with the the knob which wouldn’t return to its initial position after flushing.

However, even after they fixed the knob, the smell lessened but still persisted for the rest of our stay.

Later, I noticed in our connecting room, the same sewage smell, albeit to a much lesser degree, was prevalent, which made me think it was more of a structural issue.

As you can imagine, this made our stay extremely unpleasant. Every trip to the bathroom was a revolting experience. We explained the problem to housekeeping. Afterwards, there was zero follow up. Did they fix the problem? Did they identify the cause of the smell? How did they try to rectify it? Nothing of the sort.

We thought about asking to move rooms but the thought of packing and unpacking again for two rooms and the experience we had with the level of customer service hotel thus far was a deterrence.

Front desk, swimming pool, valet and maid service met expectations.

Overall left very unsatisfied with our stay and it was a real letdown because physically it’s a standout, beautiful property in a great location in Kowloon.

If you are big on a high level of personalized service, I would not recommend this Peninsula.

I’ve written separate reviews on the restaurants of this hotel but nothing too positive there either."
455,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Afternoon Tea,"Had afternoon tea in the lobby for my girlfriends birthday. You can’t book , there is a queuing system and it took us about 30 mins to get a table in the stunning lobby, which st this time of year is spectacular with the Christmas decorations . We had the signature afternoon tea which was fantastic , it’s on par with the Ritz in London but half the price!! At Christmas you also take away a Christmas Bauble each - a nice memento if your visit

Top tip

Get there between 1 and 3 and the queue is shorter - 4pm is peak time!! Finished st 6pm"
456,Date of stay: December 2017,50,What every luxury hotel in the world should be,"I’m fortunate to have traveled the world and stayed at several nice properties around it. This hotel is at the very top of my list. It’s subtle but everything from the airport pick up, the decor, the bar, the breakfast buffet, and service is done with cheerful professional perfection.
Our room, while smaller compared to other luxury properties, had every amenity needed and was a comfortable living space for the 2 nights we stayed.
If you want a privileged experience, this property is your place."
457,Date of stay: December 2017,50,One of the Best Hotels in the World,There is no other hotel in Hong Kong that comes near to the standards of excellence provided by The Peninsular Hotel. The levels of service are exemplary. All the dining options are first class. Choose a room with views over Victoria Harbour. Make sure you use the pool and spa. If you want the best look no further.
458,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Never disappoints,"We always make our last stop on our way back to the US, After traveling through China for two weeks, we arrived at the Peninsula for 4 nights of luxury and relaxation, they picked us a t the airport in a classic Rolls Royce, highly recommended ."
459,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Iconic Hotel,"Booked 2 nights for birthday treat purely on the basis that this is one of those hotels that has to be done especially with the Rolls Royce transfers!

Harbour view is great, room was large and well equipped except for the nightmare coffee machine! Beds extremely comfortable, service excellent and the majority of staff friendly and helpful. Good selection at breakfast and afternoon tea worth doing for the experience although not the best one we have had.

For this level of hotel there is just something missing but its 'The Peninsula' so I would stay again in the future."
460,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Luxury Hotel,"The Peninsula is a hotel with high standard of services. You can see the quality that they provided by the price we pay. The building is exceptional, the interior is a first class and they have extraordinary services. So, if you have an extra budget you can definitely stay here."
461,Date of stay: December 2017,50,Beautiful stay,We loved the incredibly beautiful ambience of this fine hotel. It is stunningly decorated for Christmas and this added to the atmosphere. We were stunned by our room which was plush and large. The high tech features were amazing. Everything was perfect.
462,Date of stay: December 2017,30,Wonderful setting for Afternoon Tea,"The best thing about afternoon tea in the Lobby at the Peninsula Hotel is the room itself. The room is beautifully proportioned and as it was close to Xmas when we went, was suitably decorated with festive fare. There's no booking, just turn up and wait. We were seated after about 40 minutes. We opted for the straight forward afternoon tea and it all comes out on a pretty stand. As one would expect, proper china, tea strainers etc are part of the ""show"".
The savoury food was okay, a nice quiche tartlette was the highlight. Next came the scones which were well risen and although a little stodgy, tasted nice. However, the cakes were definitely out of the bottom drawer, very poorly executed. First there was a green macaron. It totally lacked the texture that is the essence of a well baked macaron. It just tasted sweet and crunchy. Next there was a choux bun with a raspberry filling. Anyone who has ever made choux pastry knows that once filled, unless eaten reasonably soon, the choux pastry becomes soggy. It was. I suspect they were prepared en masse hours earlier. I could go on, but suffice it to say that the sweet section was definitely amateurish & that's being kind.
Nevertheless, we enjoyed gazing around and taking in the atmosphere, slowly sipping our tea. Then, ""entering left stage"" comes a server, who starts to clear away our table. It was quite obvious that we hadn't yet finished, but there was no holding back and another server darted in and started removing the remainder of plates etc. I held on to my cup just in case! To be honest, we found it mildly amusing.
In summary, from a food point of view this wasn't the best afternoon tea I've ever had. In fact it was decidedly average; they seriously need to get a good patisserie chef. However, the setting is lovely, so my advice would be to skip the afternoon tea, but visit the Lobby for a pot of tea & some scones."
463,Date of stay: November 2017,40,"Great pool area, nice breakfast","Earlier this year I was fortunate enough to visit The Peninsula Shanghai. The first thing I noticed is that the rooms are way smaller here in The Peninsula Hong Kong. The atmosphere is just the same: buzzing and very busy in a positive way. However if you like privacy and some rest it might be better to visit another hotel. This is the place to see and be seen.

The pool area is great with a big outside sun deck and a beautiful indoor pool. Sauna area is excellent. There are two options for breakfast: in the lobby (a la carte) or on the first floor with a buffet. Both were great with attentive staff. The hotel is located quite close to the famous Star Ferry. I took the Airport Express from the airport and then a taxi to this hotel. You can also opt for a Rolls Royce or a heli directly to the hotel."
464,Date of stay: November 2017,50,First visit to Hong Kong,I can honestly say that the Peninsula was one of the best hotels I have ever stayed at. The service was exceptional. I had a room in the tower on the 19th floor and it was fantastic. I loved the fact that they integrated so many high tech amenities into the room. Was able to even open the curtains with a iPad like device next to my bed. Will definitely stay here again.
465,Date of stay: November 2017,10,Seriously ? the worst Peninsula we visited.,"As part of a 6 days family vacation in hong kong a local friend recommended we don’t stay at the peninsula but the four seasons.

i really wanted to experience the peninsula so we booked 4 days at the four seasons and 2 days at the peninsula.
that was a mistake and we should have stay at the four seasons the whole trip.

The peninsula turned to be the worst hotel experience i had for a long time.

first when we checked in at 5pm one of the rooms was not ready until 6pm.

then when the room was ready it was smelling cigar (we were with kids on a non smoking floor) and off course that late in the day so they could not change rooms and installed a air purifier running by our bed.

the room was lacking bottles of water, we gave up and used minibar

we woke up after a bad night (noise of the purifier and smell) the next day with massive head ache
the breakfast experience is just a 20minute line to get a table...

then we went to visit kowloon and came back at 3pm rooms were not serviced. we had to call to get some water in the rooms.

management is working on finding us another room for the second night, but given it is the same price than the four seasons, just pass your way. it may just be back luck but when problem happens we did. it feel we were in a luxury hotel as we ended up paying a lot of money for a very frustrating and painful experience.

the only bright spot is the spring moon restaurant and amazing personnel."
466,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Perfect combination of Comfort & Class,"Hi

I would recommend every traveller to stay atleast once in this hotel as this is the best hotel in HKG. You might find the rooms smaller compared to other hotels outside HKG but you will find it pack with all sort of amenities which is required for a premium hotel room.

There are 2 options for breakfast : one on the ground floor and the other is on first floor. Please be noted that you should wear smart casuals even if you are on vacation.

I would also recommend to try spa in this hotel which is one of its kind. (approx. HKD 2,500)

There are many popular restaurants near to this hotel and you can approach them with ease.

Hope you will find it useful.

Cheers"
467,Date of stay: November 2017,50,The best address in Asia,"Spent three days there , top class in every category, have a cup of tea surrounded by Cartier , Van Cleef and Arpels and Luis Vuitton to name a few , fantastic staff smiles everywhere , will always keep them on my mind ."
468,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Well located luxury,"My wife and I recently had a very enjoyable few nights at the Hong Kong Peninsula and, in recognition of her birthday, we splurged on their Rolls Royce airport pick up. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that, after a 13 hour flight, it turned out to be money well spent.

Not only does the transfer provide a ride in one of their fleet of beautiful, late model Rolls Royces (complete with suicide doors), but you are also greeted at the aircraft by a hotel rep. with a golf cart, thus avoiding a fairly lengthy walk to immigration. The rep. also stayed with us, picked up our baggage at the carousel and escorted us through customs to the car.

Check in at the hotel was conducted in our room by a very polite and professional lady who explained the room’s various features. She explained that the recently refurbished room’s design was based on the theme of a private jet, maximizing the available space and conveying a sense of luxury. The designer did a good job, the relatively modest but adequately sized room exuded a feeling of quality. The exceptionally large flat screen tv and the automated espresso machine were welcome features. Everything was immaculate.

Service throughout the hotel was impeccable and we particularly enjoyed the resident’s perk of not having to join the often lengthy line up for afternoon tea.

The Hong Kong Peninsula is one of many fine 5 Star hotels in this city but none of the others have the same grand sense of history. The Kowloon side location is hard to beat and they have several very good bars and restaurants within the hotel.

The hotel and its bars and restaurants are expensive but understandably so. A true 5 Star property in every way."
469,Date of stay: November 2017,30,A bit of a Disappointment,"While this I considered a premium hotel it seems to lack on some fronts. The rooms are a bit small for this level of hotel, and we felt closed in, while comfortable they are a bit dated. The real disappointment is the lack of public lounge space. If one is going to their room and back its fine, but the entire ground floor is a large public restaurant space. The only spot to sit and relax is the one sofa across from the check-in desk. The only other space outside the room is the pool area. The balance of the space is a large shopping mall, again with no place to sit. There are better options at this price point."
470,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Amazing hotel,"I think this is the kind of hotel you imagine when you think of the ultimate hotel experience. The attention to detail and focus on service is unsurpassable. It's not cheap, but it will be one of our most memorable hotel experiences."
471,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Best hotel ever,"I love this hotel. Position of this hotel really strategic. Near from : bus station, MTR, harbour, simphony of light, harbour, avenue of star, clock tower and even shopping mall. All you need is comfort shoes 😄. Fast check in and check out. Delicious breakfast. Friendly staff. Clean and cozy rooms."
472,Date of stay: September 2017,50,Perfection in Hospitality,"The Peninsula Hong Kong never disappoints. The flagship of the brand, it delivers on all fronts. From the personal contact prior to your arrival to the tasteful decor and amenities you are hard pressed to find a more luxurious experience. The suites are incredible and the harbour views spectacular. The Spa is also worth a visit and treat yourself to the best they offer, although the hard sell for the products at the end of the treatment is a little out of place. Also make sure you reserve the Rolls Royce pick up, and if you pick a suite you get a chauffeur to drop you off anywhere in the city.
Two tiny negative, the shower in our bath suite leaked and flooded the whole bathroom. They attempted many fixes but it never worked. Nothing dramatic. There are also no late night food venues in the hotel except for a limited room service menu. Luckily lots of options outside the door.
One major plus - which for me defined the level of service. I forgot my headphones in the room. Housekeeping found them and shipped them back to me in the USA at their expense."
473,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Excellent hotel,Wonderful hotel. Impeccable service. Great room. In walking distance to the best shopping mall. Deluxe rooms good size. Good restaurants. Upper price range but definitely worth it. Has all the amenities to make a great stay.
474,Date of stay: November 2017,50,24th anibersaryo,I celebrated my 24th wedding aniversary last week. We had the best experience. I Will stay at the Peninsula whenever I can. Its the best service hotel Ive ever been in Hong Kong. It is expensive but it is worth it.
475,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Peninsula Hong Kong,Hong Kong has many hotels but none compare to the Peninsula. This hotel is upscale and not for the budget minded but if you are going to do Hong Kong in style this is the hotel for you. They pick you up from the airport in a Rolls. High Tea in the lobby is quite an experience. It is not inexpensive but if there a must. I love this hotel and highly recommend it.
476,Date of stay: October 2017,30,"Beautiful views, great location, so so service.","The location of this hotel is really fantastic, the views of the harbor are amazing especially at night when all the buildings across the harbor are lit. The service needs improvement and make sure to ask for a non-smoking room."
477,Date of stay: October 2017,30,Excellent Staff but Uncomfortable Hard Beds,"We had just come from the Peninsula in Shanghai where we had an amazing experience, so were looking forward to the Hong Kong property. We were initially put in a room in the main building which had been renovated but in the older part of the hotel. We were disappointed in the room but could have made it work if it wasn't for the beds being the hardest we've ever encountered. After a night of no sleep and a sore neck, we requested another room. The front desk staff were wonderful and gave us a nicer upgraded room in the tower. While we found the room and bath to be very nice, the bed was also rock hard. They really tried to work with us and added a layer of padding which allowed us to sleep but not ideal. This was the last stop on a 3 week trip around China where we never had any issues with beds in any of those luxury hotels or even the boat on the Yangzi. On a positive note, we found breakfast to be good both at the buffet, the lobby al a carte restaurant and for room service. Also, the front desk staff were lovely!"
478,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Perfect!,"It was my first time in Hong Kong, as I landed I first wanted to check-in in Sheraton Hotel just cross the street from the Peninsula. Since I didn’t book in advance the gentleman at Sheraton informed me that all their business suites were overbooked. As you can imagine, i was extremely tired from my trip to China for the Guangzhou fair. Luckily for me the gentleman suggested the Peninsula. Believe me when I said I was overjoyed as he directed me to that fabulous, elegant, and breathtaking place. I really don’t know how to describe this hotel, the lobby itself is something. From the charming music, the luxurious boutiques to the classic atmosphere-I just have only one word for The Peninsula Hong Kong, Perfect I mean perfect with a capital P."
479,Date of stay: November 2017,50,Best High Tea plan in HK any day or weekends,"Peninsula is a grand heritage hotel in a marvelous location in Kowloon. The lobby high tea is impeccable served with many Tea options to chose from. Biscuits, scones and finger sandwiches are a good treat for any friend or family member. Certainly this a place to stop by before any concert, ballet or performance across the road in HK Arts Centre."
480,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Another stay at one of best Grand Hotels,"This was our fourth stay at The Peninsula Hotel. It was a 5 night stay so you get to sample the services over a longer period than most guests.
For us it a break in our trip from Venice Italy where our Mediterranean holiday ended to Canberra. During our trip we had stayed at two classic hotels in Greece and Italy that were much smaller than The Peninsula in terms of rooms and guest numbers.
It was our first stay at The Peninsula in October and it is peak season in Hong Kong because it is nicer weather. Our previous trip to Hong Kong was in August and it was wet or overcast for almost the entire time of our visit.
We were aware that our flight was a long one so we choose the Rolls Royce option. This meant we were met at the airport when we got off the plane and it was certainly the right option for us. I would recommend this option to anyone who has travelled a long way or just wants a special treat!
We stayed in the same room (a Courtyard room) as on our previous trips and the service was as impeccable as always. The Courtyard room is quite large and comfortable. It is also a case of classic charm but also the latest in technology as everything is controlled by I-pads.
We were advised that the Veranda Restaurant was busy around 9 am so we ensured we were at the restaurant for breakfast before 8 am each morning. Sam is the restaurant manager now and he looked after us well (they look after the needs of those with mobility issues by placing them closer to the buffet). Kenneth Ng who was the restaurant manager when we last visited had received a well-earned promotion. Kenneth is very hands on so it was no surprise to see him in the Veranda Restaurant on the weekend and Monday morning. He also remembered us from our previous visit and that gave the stay a more personal touch.
The range of food and drinks available at breakfast is the most extensive of any hotel breakfast buffet that we had eaten at so it was not a surprise to find it is very busy during peak visitor time.
We had a number of meals and high tea at the Lobby Restaurant. The service and quality of the food was excellent.
We had the same chauffer to the airport that we had had on our previous trip 14 ago. She is a very good driver."
481,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Classic hotel,"As lovers of historic/ heritage hotels with character, the Peninsula seemed the obvious choice for a three night leisure break before flying on for the main part of our holiday in the Far East. We visited for afternoon tea many years ago and also liked the location, only five minutes walk to the Star Ferry. The Pen overall did not disappoint and we had a memorable stay.
We treated ourselves to the Rolls Royce transfers as it was for a special birthday holiday. Well worth the cost, if I am not convinced we needed it both to and from the airport. Check in was very smooth, undertaken in our Grand Deluxe Harbour View room, which had amazing views. We also very much appreciated the early check in after a long flight and the fact a light breakfast was waiting for us in the room. We had requested a room as high up as possible and the 27th floor was virtually at the top and is recommended. Some guests seem to be be given upgrades, but we were told none were available in the Tower, which was a shame, but of course fair enough. The room was relatively small, but all beautifully designed and kitted out and the bathroom was particularly luxurious. All very digital with the controls, but even I, as big of a technophobe could use it all with relative ease!
The breakfasts at the Verandah restaurant were extremely impressive, in terms of the range of items on offer and the quality, if we did have to wait five minutes for a table one morning. Other than a shared snack in the Lobby on our first day, we chose to eat outside the hotel.
We particularly liked the size and standard of the swimming pool and surrounding area, including outside decked area with sun beds. Always quiet and with very attentive staff. It was a great place to spend time after a busy day walking around the sights.
Slight disappointments...
Bar area of Felix. Small searing area and the view, given the situation, was disappointing. Why have slatted blinds and not make more of the view? All other bars were enclosed.
The lobby was very impressive, but as many other guests have commented, there are virtually no general sitting areas for guests just to enjoy the space or indeed wait for transfers etc. unless you are seated to have a meal or drink, or indeed , ask to be allocated such a table. There was almost a constant line of tourists for afternoon tea from about one pm and we had to ask for permission so to speak just to sit at a table while we waited for our transfer to the airport as there was literally nowhere else to sit and wait. I was initially told the tables were for those having lunch, yet half the tables were still empty as it was only late morning. As such, management really need to set aside an area with more sofas or general seats for guests as it seems to be a fairly consistent gripe.
Staff were very efficient and polite. There were fewer personal greetings, smiles and general enquiries etc. than at other Peninsula properties we have stayed however. Just generally a bit less welcoming each time we returned to the hotel. We moved onto the Peninsula in Manila and the difference was quite marked in this respect.
In general however, we really enjoyed our stay and found the overall quality and location of the hotel to be excellent. We did not regret our choice, loved the sense of history, and the pool was a real asset."
482,Date of stay: October 2017,50,"Impeccable (room, spa, service...)","Heard it was great and found it true after staying here. Service was attentive and friendly. Room was more spacious than I could image in HK. Deco was classic and beautiful. All facilities were designed to exceed expectation. All little things tell the quality difference and thoughts behind them. It was not the same luxury hotel from chains. It was personalized! The pool was deep enough for a real swimming. The steam room had steams that filled up the whole room rather than a corner in most places. Its boutique carries unique hotel souvenirs and price was reasonable.

If I really have to pick one thing was hoping both chef on the stations of buffet breakfast at the Verandah could be as friendly as other hotel staff. Perhaps they were trainees and still new to the Peninsula Culture? Just give them more time.

It's hard to find a place that's true to what it claimsl. Feeling great finally not something ""fake"". If in HK next time, will stay here again. Keep up the good work!"
483,Date of stay: November 2017,50,As old school as one gets!,Well if you want to get a taste of old school Hong Kong this is your go to for lunch or better yet high tea. We sat there for 2 hours savoring people watching with the more servers for customers! And the menu had something for everyone.
484,Date of stay: May 2017,40,Probably the best hotel in Hong Kong,The peninsula is one of the high end hotels in Hong Kong with the best location you can hope for near the sea. It surely provides all the luxuries of 5-star but you can expect more than that. Go for it.
485,Date of stay: October 2017,10,The single worst high-end hotel experience in my life,"Don’t buy the hype. This hotel failed to meet the standards of a cheap motel. No room available for an hour despite a 3 PM arrival for a 2 PM check in. Then tried to check us into a smoking room. And when we finally got into the room a scaffold lowered across our ‘ million dollar view’ and we were treated to the sounds and sights of repointing and painting for the rest of our stay. Even with the curtains closed the sounds awoke us early in the morning and lasted until sunset. The lobby, which was dominated by reserved tables (tea, drinks) had no seating except two chairs which were naturally always occupied. And on our second evening some awful, toxic odor—paint remover with a hint of insecticide —literally drove us into the streets. After a long day of touring we return to the hotel (having left and posted a please service sign at 8 AM) to find that the room was still being cleaned and it would be another 45 minutes until it was available. There was a twenty minute wait for breakfast which was unexceptional. And in a gesture of compensation that floored me we received a note from the manager accompanied by a pot of tea. Stay elsewhere."
486,Date of stay: May 2017,50,"TOP HOTEL, TOP SERVICE, TOP EXPERIENCE","No words. You have to live it and experience it !!! Top of the world ! Use the Rolls to arrive... go to the pool for breakfast or tea, etc etc etc.... no two like this Hotel.
PS. Have your shirts dry cleaned !!! They come back better than new."
487,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Seventh Visit and the Service and Excellence Continues to AMAZE ME!!!,"this was my 7th Visit to Hong Kong and the Peninsula, and let me tell you, it never ever disappoints....This hotel is one of the most impressive....the staff are incredible in every department, the restaurants, housekeeping, the spa , concierge, bellman and even the pool and locker room attendants.

Imagine going to a hotel, in one of the most beautiful cities in the world and not wanting to leave the premises. The hotel is so warm and friendly and they bend over backwards to make sure you have an extraordinary stay.

The guest relations team headed up by Alice Chan continues to impress me with their perfection and attention to detail and making me feel like the most important person in the hotel, even though there are hundreds others

The lobby lounge is where i like to eat most of my meals...the menu is continental with all different cuisines represented in the hotel, there is always something for everyone.

i requested my favorite room in the main building but some prefer to have a higher floor....not me i love room 327

the spa team is fantastic, the pool and fitness area are always monitored and

When i want to go down to the lobby lounge, they always find me a seat right of way, no matter how busy it is, they make the hotel guests a priority

the front desk staff as always is there making sure i have everything i need, thank you to Mateo for always taking care of me and going the extra mile...you are the best

The management team Mr. Oba and Ms. Rainey Chan are so welcoming and professional and run a wonderful hotel I thank you all for making my life and the enjoyment i get in life so much better from being with you and stay at the Peninsula Hong Kong....
this is by far the best place on earth"
488,Date of stay: October 2017,40,Perfect Peninsula,"I used to go here for lunch since 1974 and have very fond memories of the Pen. We chose to lunch at the Verandah which had a buffet. Some HK buffet can be over the top and very pricey. However, the Verandah is understated but with a nice variety of dishes for a very reasonable $480. They also have a drinks package for $118. The ambience of the restaurant is superb with a very calming colour scheme and this is relaxing over a long buffet lunch. Favourite dishes included the scallops on shell and the pork. We were attended to by Liza who was superb a credit to the Pen Group. We have not been to the Pen for years but will be returning more often."
489,Date of stay: September 2017,40,Not quite perfect..,"We took the rolls royce from the aiport to the hotel, the 'meeting' at the plane is really just an airport employee who did nothing to help us expedite customs. She just walked us to immigration, we stood in the very same queue that all other visitors did.
Driver was pleasant and the ride was as comfortable as one might expect.
The check in was faultless and took place in our room.
Unfortunately we had a small issue with an overwhelming 'damp/stale' smell in the room, fortunately this was taken care of immediately by the staff in a more than competent and satisfactory fashion.
Breakfast the Verandah was taken daily and was faultless, there was something to suit every taste, with both Western and Asian food being very good! The dining room becomes exceptionally busy we ate at 7am-ish and service was perfect, however around 9am it was very very packed and service was not quite what i would expect, used dishes were left uncleared and service was slow.
Concierge were FANTASTIC, Special thanks to Cissie who dealt so well with all our pre-planning and needs during our stay, Thank You!
The issue that many others have raised in this forum and others is that the hotel makes no provision for hotel guests above and beyond the droves who turn up for afternoon tea each day and completely over run the lobby. This leaves little or no space except the guest room for relaxation which is very very disappointing, there were always lines in the lobby. This also impacts the transport situation, upon ordering a taxi there were more often than not non-guests also waiting for a taxi.The ensuing wait was simply irritating. As a staying guest of the hotel i expect to treated differently to someone who stepped in to either have tea or depending on the time of year - came in to pick up an order of moon cakes.
This issue severely impacted our ability to rate the hotel higher.
If we were to visit hk again my husband and i both agree that we would not stay at the Peninsula again. Having visited the Four Seasons and The Ritz Carlton either would be preferable"
490,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Very grand hotel with excellent services,"The Peninsula Hong Kong is one of the best hotels in Hong Kong. We stayed in the suite for our big day. The view of the hotel facing Victoria Habor is excellent and the suite room is very big which could accommodate around 20 people to witness our ceremony. The room quality is excellent, and the service quality is extremely good."
491,Date of stay: September 2017,50,Phenomenal,"I only stayed there briefly, but I simply could not find a flaw. Everything you can possibly imagine is in the hotel room. The customised technology built into the classic, spacious rooms are like nothing I’ve ever seen.

I cannot understand why the peninsula has dropped down the rankings. Perhaps it’s the relative novelty of the Upper House and Ritz Carlton? Maybe people have tired of the ‘classic’ hotel. I absolutely lived it there regardless."
492,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Peninsula is always going to be one of the best,"Peninsula is the best classic for sure.
What I love the most about this place is that it is old but extremely well maintained therefore it feels great.
You get the old classic luxurious wooden interior which new hotels don't do anymore but at the same time new technology in the rooms.

The nail dryer is really a great touch in the dressing room.
I must say the high ceiling is one of the most important aspect too."
493,Date of stay: September 2017,50,"Equal to Villa D'Este, Lake Como, Italy? Possibly better!","After a long-haul to or from any destination back to Australia, it's such a treat to be personally greeted upon arrival, driven to and assisted with baggage collection, Rolls Royce transfer to what is one of our most fave hotels anywhere. Unobtrusive and professional service. Central Tower suites have the most amazing views and amenities, the attention to detail is faultless, staff bringing fresh tea 'welcome back' chocolate treats are appreciated but none more so than the insuite/inroom check-in avoiding lining up and waiting time at Reception. Having dined at all the in-house restaurants, there are no disappointments. Iconic, luxurious, professional, unique, attention to detail, exceptional ..... perfect!"
494,Date of stay: October 2017,50,a unique experience!,"They had one of the best pools: clean, spacious, and well-altended by great staff. Both the restaurants on ground and Ist floors are wonderful: the pastries served for breakfast are best I've had at any hotels."
495,Date of stay: October 2017,50,Simply the best legendary hotel I have stayed.,"I stayed for 3 nights. I reserved the Rolls-Royce limousine pick-up service from the airport. It was a personally guided service from right off the airplane bridge gate to my room. For the first day of the travelling, it is the best start in my experience. Everything was perfect here and this hotel truly lives up to its legendary reputation. I specially enjoyed the tablet control of everything including room control and hotel information. The bath room is huge with two wash stands and the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever used. Also, IP phone lets you make all international calls completely free. During my stay, there was a fireworks for chinese national event. Because of the location of the hotel, I could enjoy the fireworks from the hotel terrace without going to crowd packed viewing area. This was an extra benefit. This is simply the best hotel I have ever stayed and is the prime candidate for the next stay."
496,Date of stay: October 2017,40,come to celebrate my birthday month here and it is expected,"been travelling a lot and those hotels in Macau already spoiled me thus i dont put any expectation here that comparision would make me unhappy.
overall feeling is a good deal : 1 trip free rolls royce pick up, a corner suite at high level, 1 trip for 2 for the heli service for 15minutes and ride with the handsome pilot - Michael Wong (movie star too), free in room breakfast.
overall service is better than others. room amenities is magnificent but a little bit old dated. can see their attention here but the world really moving so fast to catch up the high technology accessories.
worth to pay for such a special experience."
497,Date of stay: June 2017,50,"Take the Rolls, it's worth it.","I am not a fan of airports. Taking the Rolls from the airport is one way of easing the pain. You are met by a Red Jacket who lifts your bag from the carousel, and hands you over to the hotel rep who takes you to the limousine.
After an informative drive into the city the receptionist leads you to your room and registers you there. As he finishes, the tea lady arrives. The quality of the tea in the pot or in bags is quite excellent. Although I had booked a city view, in fact I could see quite a lot of the harbourside.
My only complaint, as an old crock who likes to sit down a lot, is that when I came to checkout there was limited seating in the reception area."
498,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Grand Dame of Hong Kong,"I must be honest and say that the stay was earlier than 2016 - more like 2012/13
This was a short stopover on the way back to Sydney from London and we wanted a little bit of luxury and comfort.
The hotel is grand as you'd expect. We did book a car from the airport and it was a pleasant trip though the airport express is probably better and faster.
We booked a deluxe room and it was gorgeous. Room service top notch and all little details attended to.
We skipped the high teat but ate at one of the restaurants one night. Food was delicious, service discreet.
The peninsula is right in the heart of tourist central. Knowing what I know now about HK I'd probably head to the island rather than stay on the mainland but this was a once in a lifetime shot of pure luxury."
499,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Lavish,"The hotel is lavish with a long history. We took the Rolls Royce from the hotel which was really special. The room was perfection and so was the service and cleanliness. The pool and spa are the best I have ever seen in any country in any hotel. The pool staff is fantastic. The only thing I didn't like about the hotel is that it's a tourist attraction so there are always a ton of people in the lobby. There wasn't really a place to go and relax to have a cup of coffee, except the pool or your room. Also, for such a lavish hotel I thought the food would be better. Other than that, this is about the best you are going to get. It's near the harbor and located in a tourist part of the city."
500,Date of stay: September 2017,10,A chain is as strong as it's weakest link,"We came into Hong Kong yesterday and everything was perfect, as is to be expected from the Peninsula, till ""the incident"" occurred. Let's start chronologically...

We were greeted at the aircraft gate by an efficient lady who swiftly carted us to the duty free shop since we wanted to buy some things. She then took us to Immigration where she ""created"" a special line for us so that we could proceed without delay. She was waiting at the other side with a porter. As we were walking through customs, she muttered something to the customs officials and we walked right through, where after we were greeted by the airport Rep of the hotel. He guided us to our waiting Rolls Royce and we had a pleasant drive to the hotel with Stanley, the chauffeur.

Jessica Cheng, the Guest Relations Supervisor, was waiting for us outside, at the hotel entrance. She whisked us straight to our suite, The Golden Jade Suite, where a welcome breakfast had been laid out on the small dining table in the living room, and where the desk had stationary embossed with our name, etc., etc.

But, this is the Suite that we had booked, while our booking had an upgrade to the next level Suite, subject to availability. As Jessica was not aware of this, she made a quick discreet call and within minutes, Martin Goic, the Assistant Front Desk Manager, was at our door.

He explained that the upgrade Suite was available for only 2 nights, then sold out for a night and then available thereafter. We asked if we could see the Suite, and then came the shocker.

While walking to the upgrade Suite (at the other end of the same floor) Martin casually mentioned that he could give it to us if we paid 1000 extra, per night. Whoa! Wait a minute... I thought he had said it was sold out for our 3rd night? So it would suddenly become available if we paid extra?

That is not all. Once in the upgrade Suite, he started a ""one-sided negotiation"" with us saying he would now offer it to us if we paid 500 extra per night (for all nights that we were staying in the hotel).

To be clear, we had booked directly with the Peninsula Reservations team. The ""package"" offered to us was the same as was viewable on the Peninsula hotel website.

The package clearly stated that our booking included a ""Complementary room upgrade to next category (subject to availability upon arrival)"".

Now, upon arrival we were being told 2 different things. One, that there was no availability so no upgrade, and two, that the upgrade room would somehow ""become available"" if we paid more!!!

This is just NOT acceptable and Peninsula would be wise to look into this matter at the earliest.

Of course, the one sided haggling is also something not acceptable from the Peninsula.

And today, one day later, the upgrade Suite still shows as available for booking (for our entire stay) on the Peninsula website!

As they say, it takes one bad apple to spoil the bunch. In this case, this episode took away all the positives and left a very, very bad taste in the mouth.

We have a few reservations at some of the better restaurants at the Peninsula, and are now quite motivated to cancel the same."
501,Date of stay: March 2017,50,The best of everything,"The renovations of the rooms at this hotel were done with such thought and attention to detail that nothing was over-looked. They are very comfortable and have everything you want or need with all the high tech amenities in place. We arrived early in the morning and were given use of the Spa until our room was ready, which they had ready by 10AM! The staff is very accommodating. Do not miss having breakfast at The Verandah or lunch/drinks/tea in lobby. We had a wonderful, luxurious, stay on both ends of our trip to Asia. Though I'm not in love with the 'new' Hong Kong, after having traveled there since 1979, I am in love with the new Penninsula."
502,Date of stay: February 2017,50,All the Wonderful Penicities at The P.,"Kowloon harbour was the last rail stop on the Trans-Siberian rail link that brought travellers from Europe to Asia, and The Peninsula, which opened in December 1928 was there to welcome visitors from all over the world from then to now.

From the grand entrance to the deluxe room, all areas seemed to be filled with elegance and remnants of European style. Upon first glance, I was a little surprised by the smallness of the room and the largeness of the bathroom. But the exotic assortment of fruit on fine china and all the penicities (according to the dennylama dictionary of words: Peninsula nice things/small goodies=Penicities) made up for the size. One stunning penicity was an intricately carved box that contained a honey-scented soap, which made for a memorable keepsake for guests to remember their fine stay at The P.

The room was equipped with all sorts of seamlessly hidden techy-gadgets, which was an adventure in itself. There was a seamless wooden panel that opened to a small compartment devoted to business apparatus and usage at no extra cost. Another panel opened up to an abundant tea and coffee section for morning tea and the entertainment panel had a variety of plugs and sockets for international connections of your electronic devices. How thoughtful was that?

The room was clean and well-maintained with a flair of sophistication in the selection of furnishings and dishware. The gym and spa staff were accommodating and gracious. They offered us more penicities, such as small bottles of water, apples, towels, etc. Afternoon tea in the lobby was delightful because we were able to make a reservation for a table without waiting in the long queue and dim sum at Spring Moon was a tasty affair, it was dim sum with a creative twist different from their local Hong Kong counterparts.

After staying at The P., all the other hotels paled in comparison. It was a true highlight of our Hong Kong trip."
503,Date of stay: March 2017,50,As always the best,"This is my second stay in 2017 in the Peninsula and no disappointment on all services, despite being a no-compromising guest. Manager as well as every staff were doing everything to make my stay an excellent one. Also, the breakfast and the SPA were outstanding. I really enjoy my stays. Congratulations to all."
504,Date of stay: July 2017,50,A legend,"As I am sometimes a little bit into history n legend, staying at this place was kind a Must.

Just forget to get a room around new year! At Chinese new year even worse. One need to book for this time of the year at least 6 months in advance. At least according to my latest experience.

As expected, the service was fantastic, well still far from the Ritz in Paris but then the price here is more for the human being. The place itself was awesome. I gotta love every details in it.

Nope, I didnt have the chance to book the helicopter-ride to the airport so couldnt tell much about it.

Once you are there, pls dont miss to dine it ... and the tea time at the lobby.

Once you"
505,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Superb Accomodations - First Trip to Hong Kong,"The accommodations and the staff are superb with every effort to please the guests. The staff intro to the room gadgets was a necessity given all the buttons and remote controls. We especially enjoyed making reservations (through the hotel) for the afternoon tea, and skipping the line. I agree with another Peninsula HK review stating the lobby is extremely crowded with ""outsiders;"" this distracts from the intimacy and uniqueness of the hotel."
506,Date of stay: September 2017,50,The best hotel ever,"A great hotel in all aspects, overwhelming architecture, beautiful lobby, wonderful service, high-tech but comfortable bedrooms.
Highly recommendable, par excellence!
The 28th floor, the bar, has excellent view of the harbor, tho I wonder why the blinds must always hinder the magnificent view????"
507,Date of stay: July 2017,50,A super luxury hotel,"After few times in HK, we decided to stay for the first time at this fantastic hotel. its location is excellent, the rooms are new, large and very ""computerized"". The staff is so helpful and polite, breakfast buffet is delicious, the pool is amazing. The only reject that i found there, was the fact that it is very very crowded with ""outsiders"". I think that the management must permit the enterance to the hotel's lobby, only for the hotel's guests. I think that it is the best 5 stars hotel in HK, that we stayed in (and we stayed in about 4 of them). Highly recommended."
508,Date of stay: September 2017,30,Loosing the panache that made it great!,"I have had the pleasure of staying in the Hotel Peninsula chain around the world, all are an exceptional five star premises. My concern with the Peninsula Hong Kong is it maybe loosing all that it has become famous for. Most of its old colonial charm is being nudged out at the same rate as the updated deco is taking effect. As a resident of the hotel I found myself queuing for breakfast on a Sunday morning as tables were not available, and this was at 0830hrs! Like one other reviewer I was chastised for wearing open toed sandles whilst at the same time it was all right for our oriental friend to sit at a table and continually clear his throat and chest, something I am told is to be expected? Is that to be expected now the hotel is more affordable and we must now put up with this providing they are wearing shoes? It is a shame it is loosing the charm we all once experienced and enjoyed and I am sure that for every mediocre review there will be ten good ones together with an explanation from the management team why it is taking the current line and policy, however, it could be a slippery slope!"
509,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Give me the luxury of life and I do without the necessity,"Number one hotel address in Hong Kong if you have seen the classic movies "" Love is a many splendid thing "" by William Holden and Ava Garner , also the Soldier of Fortune by Clark Gable , the hotel has been famous for almost a hundred years , it was taken as the headquarter for the Japanese invasion forces during WW2 in Hong Kong . But dont get me wrong if this is an old and run down hotel , in fact it has been remodeled and upgraded constantly and come with a heli pad for your jet set needs. The price of course is with its image and not for everyone . Its the best hotel in Hong Kong for business ."
510,Date of stay: December 2016,40,The Establishment Visited,"This hotel is just amazing and so good. They have airport pick up service and help us with our luggage. The room was great with a excellent view, and they checked us in, The receptionist explained everything so well. We got Chinese high tea when we arrived, so lovely. The breakfast buffet is very good and lot of choice. Also the room service was great. All of the staffs were very nice and kind."
511,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Amazing hotel! Very good service,"This hotel is just amazing and so good. We got an airport pick up, from the gate somebody was there to help us with our luggage and we went to the hotel with a Rolls Royce!

The room was great with a fabulous view, and they checked us in, in the room so our son could play in the room and don't need to wait at the desk. The receptionist explained everything so well. We got Chinese high tea when we arrived, so lovely.

The breakfast buffet is very good and lot of choice. Also the room service us great. We loved the pool and especially my 15 months old son loved it so we went every day.

The staff is very friendly and just so much service! This is a 10 star hotel👍😃."
512,Date of stay: September 2017,20,For snobs only. Not for a relaxing holiday.,"Rooms and facilities are great... but the guy at the pool could be more tactful. There is a dress code that my partner was aware of but failed to tell me. Breakfast buffet on the balcony- the girl must have not noticed I was wearing flip flops when I went in, but when I sat down then informed me curtly of the dress code and advised me that whilst I was already there today, they would turn a blind eye to it, but requested I arrive tomorrow in more appropriate footwear.
Whilst it is totally understandable given there is a dress code, the manner in which the message was conveyed to me made me feel extremely belittled- like I was not ""good enough"" to be at a snobby hotel like this. Given the amount we pay for a room here, I would not recommended this place for an Aussie on holiday.
I have stayed at a number of luxury hotels... and this is the first one I am looking forward to checking out of tomorrow."
513,Date of stay: September 2017,30,Below Par,"The Peninsula at Hong Kong is reputed to be as luxurious as it is old-established. The house Rolls-Royces parked at the entrance give you the flavour on arrival. The check-in was rather lengthy, considering that our reservations had been made well in advance, and we had no special requests. The room I was given was a disappointment: it smelled - badly: something like old, fried onions. When I complained, I was offered an air purifier, before suggesting a change of room. The second room was much better, but hardly sweet-smelling. I was surprised - to say the least.
On the other hand, the service was unfailingly polite and efficient, and our dinner in the house Chinese restaurant was good.
Would I return to the Pen? I doubt it - there are too many good hotels in HK from which to choose."
514,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Simply Exceptional !,"The Peninsula was probably the best experience of a hotel in my whole life as a consumer.
Everything was great !
From the roomy space of the entrance of this hotel with their ""own private limousines"" to the concerts given in the afternoon or the quality of their rooms, everything was more than expected.
Is there really much more to say ? I am not sure.
Oh yes maybe the kindness and quality of service of the whole staff was up to its reputation.
It is definitely the place to be !"
515,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Lobby Lounge Dinner,"The set dinner at The Peninsula Lobby Lounge is really worth for money. The steak was professionally cooked and tender.

With the live music provided in the lobby make a traditional Victorian style atmosphere.

That the reason why we need to queue for table in the lobby lounge.

Recommend to visit for tourists and locals."
516,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Perfect romantic getaway,"My husband surprised me by reserving a weekend at one of the Suites at Peninsula Hotel Hong Kong for a romantic getaway to celebrate one of our special occasions and I could only say it was the best arrangement not having to travel out of town for a romantic weekend.

We walked into the hotel room welcomed by petals of roses and bottle of champagne with rose cake to welcome our arrival. Nice touches including personalized card and fruit basket.

In addition the dining selections at the hotel regardless French, Chinese or Swiss all are top notch. We were spoiled at each meals.

It's beautiful indoor heated swimming pool and lounge by the pool also offered wonderful relaxing hours during our stay that I wish I could have the year long membership to enjoy its pool!

Overall it was truly a memorable experience, short of the helicopter ride sometimes some guests would choose to enjoy sky views of Hong Kong - perhaps next time!"
517,Date of stay: September 2017,50,Best in Hong Kong,"Used the airport pickup with the Rolls Royce for convenience and style! Flawless pickup from the airbridge and smooth ride in to town.

Magnificent hotel with excellent rooms. Automated room services to control the lights, curtains and temperature.

Beautiful bathroom with plenty of accessories.

Service is beyond perfect with any request handled promptly and with a smile.

This will always be my first choice in Hong Kong and I cannot wait to come back."
518,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Superb luxury hotel!,"We stayed at The Peninsula for 2 weeks and it made our holiday. With all the amenities you could ask for, our stay was extremely pleasant and relaxing.
The service at this hotel was excellent - from reception and dining to poolside and housekeeping, the staff could not do enough for us. Always polite and courteous yet friendly, addressing us by our names added a personal touch.
The room amenities are great, the beds huge and comfy and the bathrooms are really something with two sinks with vanity areas, magnifying lighted mirrors, a huge bathtub with a TV and all the toiletries you may need. An added bonus is the welcoming gift of chocolates which the hotel specialises in and a plate of fruit which is refreshed daily. Bottles of Evian are left at each bedside every evening too. Tea and coffee at your disposal too via a Nespresso machine. Everything is controlled via electronic touch pads including the curtains.
Afternoon Tea was lovely with the most amazing teas served in silverware and the lightest fluffiest fruit scones with clotted cream and homemade strawberry jam as well as other sweet treats and mini savoury bits.
The pool is fantastic - large enough to swim full lengths with smaller spa pools coming off it. Sunbathing on the deck gives a beautiful view of Hong Kong island. Iced water and flannels are brought to you on your arrival at the pool and you can order drinks, snacks or a light lunch (the best chips ever!) there too.
I'm so happy we chose this hotel. It has surpassed my expectations and made our holiday extremely enjoyable. Thank you for remembering that luxury hotels not only apply to the quality of the hotel furnishings, decor and amenities - but equally as important is the service provided by all the staff to their guests."
519,Date of stay: September 2016,40,My luxury stay in Hong Kong,"it was in 2015 I traveled to Hong Kong Peninsula, I was pampered from the airport till they drop me back to airport, that too was their popular Rolls Royce transfer service. The hotel is perfectly located and having every amenities for a luxury hotel does. The helicopter ride and yacht trip offered by the hotel was thrilling !!! if you want an unforgettable holidays in HKG, this is the place."
520,Date of stay: August 2017,50,"A Check on most people's ""bucket list""","For HK expats and probably most folks from Asia this hotel is historic and the standard for luxury. Expensive? Of course. Overall, the place didn't disappoint from beginning to end, for the most part.

Expect the person that checks you in to accompany you to your room and provide a thorough electronic orientation--since EVERYTHING here is iPad controlled.

It was a very nice elegant touch that upon check in someone came to our room with a nice tray of hot tea for us. The room is well equipped with coffee and tea machines with accompanying ceramic wear--although the cute small blue Chinese tea pot in the room had its holding wires broken -- as evident by previous attempts to superglue the wire back together. I would suggest to management, for safety purposes, to examine these tea pots in each room to see how safe the holding wires are. Otherwise, it's an accident waiting to happen. The glass ware for booze was exceptional. Although there were so many different draws that I couldn't even locate the beer bottle opener.

Although I didn't get to try out the Focal headphones that one has to retrieve from Housekeeping, it was good to know that they had a top brand headphone available.

Our adult son accompanied us on the trip and we got a rollout bed as well as memory foam pillows with no problem. Our son definitely enjoyed the bathtub with electronic controls for the TV to be viewed while in the tub.

In the bathroom were two faucets at opposite end of the room, with a shower room with a door along with a toilet with a door. The privacy was nice to have but we had to let the toilet door remain open since the smell from the plumbing work was bad even when one hasn't used the toilet after hours.

The shops in the hotel are obviously very high end and expectedly unaffordable to many. The gym had a great view of the harbor and most standard current equipment plus some free weights-- not that there was anyone working out during our stay. Staff was very efficient in the check in area for the gym as well as hot tub.

The line for the afternoon tea service obviously had a long queue. Having previously had their tea service elsewhere I'm not so impressed so didn't try the same here.

I would definitely stay here again but hope the little details are addressed. Perfection is hard to maintain."
521,Date of stay: August 2017,50,"Great, but no longer perfect....","I love this hotel, I 1st stayed here 12 years ago and it was perfect. Sadly it is no longer perfect, but still excellent.
The rooms are lovely, very well done with every possible amenity thought of.
What's changed.... it seems to be the staff just aren't up to the job anymore.
I recently stayed here for 4 nights, ate in the hotel restaurants, uses the bar, used the pool and pool bar but didn't get any personal service, no name used (despite them seeing me at the bar many times giving my room number)
The concierge desk is very poor for a hotel of this quality, I expected better, I have had much better in the past. They didn't have any knowledge about the area, bars, directions, etc. The pool terrace is poorly staffed, drinks take too long to arrive despite there been hardly any other guests using the area. I would expect table service but this was hap-hazard. When sitting on a sun deck in a hotel such as this I would expect table service, I would also expect the staff to understand their drinks menu and be able to make the drinks on their menu in a timely manner. May seem petty, but this is not a cheap hotel, they claim to be one of the best hotels in the world. They need to revisit some areas, because they are not as good as they were..."
522,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Once upon a time,"I came to the Peninsula 20 years ago.

Hong Kong was the first leg of my original trip to Asia. I was 15 and on my way to a fishing camp with my father. We stayed at the Peninsula for two nights before flying off to Beijing and a 60h train & bus ride which would lead us to our final destination in the Mongolian plain, so it was treat before things were going to get tougher.

I remember being mesmerized by the outer skiline & the buzzing lights of hong kong. The city seemed bigger than life with contrasts of life in every facet of its being. The bustle was the aura of a city on the move. And after 20 years, if I can't recall the look of the room or the lobby. I can remember the feeling of solemn calm, comfort and luxury the hotel offered.

So if you want to offer your family an unforgetable moment & feeling they can cherish down the road, Hong Kong and the Peninsula might be the place."
523,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Expensive but worth every penny!,"Great location, with helpful staff (except lobby dinner service in separate review) and super service.
Rooms have every detail attended too - desks even come equipped with office equipment and stationary (stapler, highlighter etc) even had nail drier in the vanity station !!
Lucky enough to stay in many 5 star hotels but the room accessories at the Penn are quite extraordinary ..... stay and enjoy !!"
524,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Nothing more grand this this gem,We only wish that we could move in! We loved everything from the ample rooms to the incredible pool. Food in every location was amazing. The service is the best in the world. The products in the bathroom are not to be believed!
525,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Booked for nostalgic reasons; it was perfect and would choose again,"I had last stayed at the hotel when I was a child and was keen to revisit. The hotel was beautiful, hotel reception very helpful and we were offered a very attractive upgrade option. The standard of the rooms, decoration, cleanliness etc. was first rate. The staff were all very helpful and friendly. My children especially loved the chocolate gift box waiting in their rooms. It amused us that, as a family of 5 we couldn't fit in the Rolls but instead travelled to the airport in a hotel mini van with all our luggage travelling in style in the Rolls Royce."
526,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Luxury with amazing views,"We had a stay-cation at the The Peninsula and were amazed at almost every turn. An upgrade on arrival, fantastic spa, swimming pool with million dollar views and an afternoon tea that is a must. The space was peaceful, and the only (minor) criticism I would have would be that the restaurants did stack up as well as some of the nearby options in the souther kowloon area. However, on the whole - would absolutely stay again."
527,Date of stay: August 2017,50,5 day break,Good hotel - location perfect staff good - leisure facilities good rooms spacious- downside view( booked through travel agent) - breakfast fantastic- busy foyer need to be a bit more selective- otherwise really can not criticize this hotel - concierge very helpful
528,Date of stay: September 2016,50,My favourite hotel,I have been very lucky to travel all around the world and stay at some magnificent hotels. However the peninsula Hong Kong will always have a special place in my heart. It is a truly beautiful hotel with unparallel service. Do not hesitate to stay here on your Hong Kong trip and be prepared to be pampered and to enjoy a luxurious stay in the heart of Hong Kong. I have been lucky enough to stay here several times and loved each time.
529,Date of stay: July 2017,50,A BEAUTY TO BEHOLD,"I loved every bit of the Peninsula, HK. The hotel is quite classy and has a rich vibe to it. It is well situated just a five (or less) minute walk to the Tsim Sha Tsui (mtr) station making it quite easily accessible.
I loved the service as well as their well prepared meals. They have these luxury brands for the shopping lovers and since it is situated quite centrally, one can leave the hotel and go budget shopping elsewhere without much hassle.
I honestly do not know what´s not to love about this place! Highly recommended."
530,Date of stay: August 2017,50,A concert,This building is absolutely in a fantastic central position with bay's view from some rooms.Everything inside is in the right position and all the staff work hard to join this aim. It seem like an orchestra and it's rare to find place like this.
531,Date of stay: September 2016,40,Very classic hotel,"Very well located - near the TST station. Lots of shopping near the hotel, both luxury as well as budget.

The rooms were enormous, as were the bathrooms. The decor itself was too classic for my taste and quite dark.

The pool was beautiful! I could swim there everyday. Lots of incoming natural light and designed like a Roman bath. Beautiful pool!

Restaurants are also excellent. I'd especially recommend Chesa, the Swiss restaurant."
532,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Best afternoon tea in town,"The Peninsula is a very classical and prestigious hotel. Plenty of nice stores inside. Do not miss the afternoon tea that is a ""must do"" in HK. Don't have lunch before otherwise it will be to much. They serve an incredible plater of cakes, scones and sandwiches. If it's too much for you, do like me just order a nice patisserie . The tea selection is great and the cappuccino delicious."
533,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Excellent service and location,"Very nice hotel and located in the heart of hong kong. Walking distance to the spots we intended to visit. Perfect for couples. As i was with my family, my kids did not really have something to enjoy. Excellent staff in the front desk. They allowed us to checkin early and the rooms were just amazing. Price is a bit steep but quality of service comes with it. I would recommend this to couples. Keep up the good work!"
534,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Top of the line...,"Our start of a three week journey through part of Asia was, even though it was Taifun season - the best place to be. Forthcoming service, the rooms to the highest standard renovated, perfect view - just unbelievable!"
535,Date of stay: August 2017,50,Brilliant and Beautiful,"An amazing and extremely well designed and appointed hotel, worthy of its standing as The Best. Rooms - unbelievable, well sized, well designed and beautifully furnished. The restaurants are equally so with the quality of the ingredients tops.

The standout at The Peninsula however is the level of care, support and assistance from every person we came across regardless in which section they were working.

Congratulations to all of you."
536,Date of stay: July 2017,40,Very good - one thing missing,"This is really a perfect place to stay. Service is very good, location perfect, facilities perfect. What's missing then.

Service.. Kind of robotic, trained and we couldn't feel much warmth. High prices might not be the only sign of quality. It's the approach of the staff towards the customer that makes the difference. I sent a request via TripAdvisor before our arrival- no response. We asked for later check-out and were promised a message - we didn't receive it.

It's just those little differences that make the difference. We were missing the warmth in service. Next time we might stay somewhere else."
537,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Amazing!!!,"Fantastic hotel, fantastic staff!!! From the moment we walked into the hotel till the moment we left it was like being in a different world.

Marco who checked us in continued to check on us and make sure we were ok right till the end. He even went out and got us an amazing book on the hotel because we ""expressed"" an interest in buying such a book.

The concierge staff were so helpful and accommodating even when my husband put them through the paces.

Our room faced out on the Harbour and the view at anytime was fantastic. The room itself is one of the best equipped rooms that I have seen in a long time.

There is a really cosy bar, really well stocked and Jimmy provided us with great entertainment each evening.

This is one hotel that should be on everyone's bucket list. I had the best holiday because everything worked the way it should and nothing was a problem or impossible for anyone. Thank you Peninsula - I can't wait to come back!!!"
538,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Lunch at The Lobby..,"Marvelous and classy. Still one of the very very best places in the world. Cool Chablis and nicely toasted crabmeat-avocado sandwich; luke warm coleslaw and french fries, could not be better. Service impeccable and fruit tart and coffee on the house, lovely hospitality. Thanks to Mr. Peter Angst and the staff of The Lobby: great job."
539,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Amazing Hotel!,"We began our 2 week stay in China with a 2 night stay in The Peninsula which turned out to be our favorite hotel. It is an amazing place with gorgeous views of the harbor. The fitness room, spa, and pool are among the best I have seen in any hotel and the food is outstanding. A wonderful experience overall. Highly recommend."
540,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Absolutely outstanding!,"This hotel has everything you would wish for, from superb accommodation to excellent service, first class restaurants and tremendous views over Victoria Harbour. We could find nothing to complain about throughout our stay, and experienced the unique class of this first class hotel. We stayed in a luxuriously appointed suite overlooking the harbour, and had to force ourselves to leave the hotel to see more of Hong Kong's magic."
541,Date of stay: July 2017,40,Oustanding but in some ways price does not match quality,"Outstanding grand dame hotel of hong hong.
Staff is friendly and accomodating in everyway and our deluxe habour view room although on the small side was beautiful with every amenity you could wish for.
That said the price level here overall matches oligarks from russia and noveau riche from mainland china - both categories of which you will see plenty in the hotel.
And here money does not always match quality. Gawdy displays of diamonds and gold as present as it is in Dubai (and no that is not a complement).
Bad taste galore in many of the guests - unfortunately. Maybe a dresscode that is actually enforced would be an idea (we saw plenty of gentlemen in shorts and t-shirts in the Spring Moon restaurant for dinner) -otherwise you feel a bit of an idiot dressing up for an elegant dinner.
Afternoon tea is the lobby is a bit overhyped and not worth the money and the 400HKD breakfast is certainly not worth the pricemark.
It seems that while the rooms albeit expensive do have a certain relationship to the product offered, all the extras do not - they are in fact way off the mark - clearly geared toward the (in my view) rather undesirable segment of clientele that I would actually prefer not to associate with to a large extent.
Am I too harsh? perhaps put this is the top knotch of the city's offer and it is just a tad too much for my taste - take a look at the Mandarin Hotel in Bangkok and learn - thats how it should be done ..."
542,Date of stay: July 2017,50,The very best and top of the class service,This obviously one of the top hotel in HK. It obviously comes with a premium service and pricing. The breakfast was superb on the three mornings we were there. Excellent all round from the bell boy to the duty manager. Not to be missed for the cream la cream service if you can afford to spend here.
543,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Fantastic Stay,"A short one night visit before taking a cruise in HK, this hotel also known as the legendary “Grande Dame of the Far East” offers a blend of Eastern and Western hospitality in an atmosphere of unmatched classical grandeur and timeless elegance. The lobby and common areas allow you to explore the many antiques and historical artifacts on display around the hotel. Rooms are very nice with elegant furnishings and fantastic views of the bay. We got late to the hotel and had to order room service, which is probably one of the best Chinese meals we ever had. Breakfast is a combination of local and international dishes, were many exotic ingredients can be taste for an extraordinary experience. Only objection is the amount of construction around the hotel, which makes it nor the friendliest locations for a walk to know the area. Overall, top Peninsula quality and a short but very satisfying experience."
544,Date of stay: June 2017,40,Not Overly Impressed But Solid Stay,"I had traveled to Kong Kong in 2016 and stayed at the Ritz Carlton, which was a fantastic experience. However, this trip was for my honeymoon and so we decided to try a new hotel. After doing weeks of research, we opted for The Peninsula. Prior to arriving, I contacted the hotel to setup dinner reservations, which the concierge promptly took care of. I also let them know we were celebrating our honeymoon and arranged the the Rolls Royce round trip airport transfer.

We had an early arrival at HKG and were met by an airport rep right outside of our plane, which comes with the RR transfer. She took us on a cart to immigration and then her and porter assisted us with our bags. We were escorted to the car by another hotel rep, and then took the car to the hotel. The experience was absolutely seamless and I would highly recommend it, especially for special occasions. Once we arrived at the hotel were checked in, and as I had booked via American Express FHR, and it was our honeymoon, I expected to get a room upgrade. I purposely booked one room below a harbor view king expecting the upgrade, but those rooms were apparently sold out and we didn't get an upgrade. Not a big deal, but if you really want harbor view room and you're staying on a weekend, don't count on an upgrade. The check in staff were very friendly.

We were happy that our room was ready given our early arrival, but unfortunately the room wasn't exactly what were expecting. It was quite small, and the toilet was leaking a colored water. This wasn't satisfactory to us, so I asked for us to have a new room. They offered us one in the same category a few floors down, and seemed apologetic, but I don't know why the bathroom was checked before we got into the room. Nevertheless, the room itself (again besides the size) was well done, especially the touch screen controls.

We didn't eat in any of the hotel restaurants except for having tea and breakfast in the lobby. We also had dessert there one night. The lobby gets packed during the day with tourists but you can use the side and back entrances. The lobby staff were also very kind and helpful as well, except for one instance where I asked the location of the nearest restroom. Instead of walking me part of the way as many 5 star hotels do, this person just pointed in a certain direction, which actually made me more confused given I had just traveled there searching for the bathroom.

We did visit the pool, which is very beautiful. There are two ""tubs"" on the edge of the pool, but both are filled with cold water.

I would certainly stay here again but may first check out other hotels in Hong Kong. For Kowloon, the location is certainly better than the Ritz, but if you spend a lot of time on the other side the location is inconvenient. The friendly staff here goes a long way, especially given the issue we had with the room upon check in."
545,Date of stay: December 2016,50,"Elegance, aristocracy, class","One of the most costly places in HK n yet so elegant n beautiful, you won't regret spending the amount you do spend here, do try gaddis the food is yummi.... And yes the views of the Victoria harbour is superb"
546,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Great Hotel and Resort,"I visited around Christmas. It is a great hotel with great resort activities, considering it is located right in the city center. They offer spa services, ranging from massage, facial, baths, etc. location-wise, it is very close to kowloon landmarks, nathan road, and the mtr stations."
547,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Bucket list place to stay,"Everything about this hotel is everything you've heard about it.Forget the cost just do it, and add to the experience by taking the Rolls Royce package from the airport. Just superb.Join the groups website and keep an eye out for specials,"
548,Date of stay: July 2017,50,The perfect oasis in the middle of chaotic Kowloon,"We stayed at The Peninsula and we really think it's worth it.
With its colonial flavor, a totally dedicated staff, exquisite service, amazing pool with stunning views of the bay... for us was a total oasis to come back every day after enjoying the city"
549,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Round the world stop # 4,If there was ever a hotel that deserves #1 hotel in the world it is this one. It has it all. Fabulous location in a fabulous city. Rooms terrific with every high tech amenity to make a visit more enjoyable plus lots of well planned space. Fitness city absolutely outstanding. One of the best I have ever seen / on par with Bellagio but in a smaller space. Food was great but expensive. Service was over the top. All the other guys need to just go to school on P - Hong Kong. Only gripe would be that they have a fabulous roof top bar looking out over Victoria Harbor and they have Venetian blinds hanging down obscuring the view!! We asked if they could be raised never dreaming they would say no and they said no. Seems folks ask all the time for the same reason we did and the answer is it is part of the decor and must be left down. Now they are open(slats in a flat position) but who wants to look through that at the great view? You can see I really had to work to find a negative. Ask for room 2210 - has to be best room in the house.
550,Date of stay: March 2017,50,A Little Bit of Paradise,"Recently visited The Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo.
And only the only the original gets it absolutely right. There's a formula to The Peninsula -
large lobbies filled with dining tables, music, and really chic shops blatantly pushing their wares.
Lobby menus can be really pricey, and this is not the place to lounge. Somehow in Hong Kong
it catches the spirit of the town. I've been a fan since 1957, and the din and the bustle just works.
Add to this magnificently appointed rooms, the finest concierge service in the world, and a truly
first class shopping experience, and they're still the best in Hong Kong. Surprisingly, no one tells you at check-in that phone service is free anywhere in the world. ( And the bar upstairs is justifiably forgotten.)
Shanghai is almost as good, and Beijing far outshines the competition."
551,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Loved 🇭🇰 Penninsula,"Peninsula hotel is located on the harbor with a great view from our room on 22nd floor. The hotel is a classic, well maintained, numerous bar and dinner options. We are all our meals there very good food. Expensive but convenient and no worries about food safety. Alcohol is expensive but you are paying for the view and the class of the hotel being a 5 star. Beautiful people stay here, classy well dressed Chinese. Our room was spacious, spa music in the bathroom, two sinks with lighted mirrors, shower and separate tub. We are on a long journey, I asked for a steamer to steam my clothes and no problem left it in the room to use entire time. Cedrick the concierge was helpful guiding us on some impromptu ideas. We hired a day guide and while expensive it is well worth the money because HongKong is congested. Hotel staff were all superb."
552,Date of stay: July 2017,50,My Favourite Hotel in the World,"Another brilliant stay at The Peninsula, Hong Kong. We stayed for four nights on the way back from Italy in a courtyard room. I like to stay in the old building. The rooms have been refurbished since our last visit and the results are spectacular - luxurious and classic. They have literally thought of every need. Service from every department was friendly, polite, efficient, proactive with staff members frequently anticipating our needs. This visit we ate at Felix, Spring Moon, The Verandah, and The Lobby on a number of occasions and relished each experience. The bar is also a great place for a night time drink with a charming pianist softly playing. The pool and spa are spectacular! Housekeeping was superb and the concierge team probably the best I have ever experienced - Joyce was a particular standout. Our excellent experience with the concierge team commenced months before we arrived and was extremely impressive. With my hand on my heart I can say that this is probably my favourite hotel in the world. From the moment you step into the Rolls Royce Phantom at the airport, your Peninsula experience begins. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Highly recommended!"
553,Date of stay: June 2017,40,"An enjoyable return stay, with the exception of the Lobby Afternoon Tea.","I’ve stayed at the Peninsula a couple of time prior – one stay being excellent and the follow up having some basic service issues which you don’t expect for a hotel in its class. I hoped it would be back on form on this visit. In summary, a very enjoyable stay – with the exception of the Lobby for Afternoon Tea (and my attempt to reserve a table via the hotel concierge). More detail should you wish…

The arrival experience is excellent. Booking hotel transport, on arrival you are escorted via buggy from the air bridge/gate and on arrival at the hotel you’re escorted from the car for in-room check in. Luggage was quickly delivered. On departure, staff at check out were friendly, however conversation was minimal (not even a 'how was your stay?').

The Superior Harbour View Suite was beautifully appointed, spacious and well maintained. Whilst it’s been a few years since the refurbishment, you would assume it was just yesterday. Attention to detail is excellent – universal chargers, noise cancelling headphones, complementary international VoIP calls, tablets to control all in-room functions (as well as ordering room service), and even a switch to turn the bathroom into a “spa” (auto adjusts for mood lighting and soft ambient music). With unobstructed views of Hong Kong harbour, and the stunning skyline of Hong Kong Island, the suites in the tower provide one of the best hotel accommodation views in the city.

The spa treatment was excellent.

The breakfast buffet is excellent, with a broad selection incl. continental, European & Asian cooked items, and omelette station. Staff were friendly and attentive.

As for Afternoon Tea in the lobby, the worst I’ve experienced at any hotel I’ve stayed. The fact that they cannot get basics of service or food correct is a disgrace for such a renowned hotel. See separate review for further details. The negative of the stay."
554,Date of stay: July 2017,50,"My 6th Visit, Only gets better ....ALWAYS PERFECTION","from the minute I arrived at the airport to my departure, The Peninsula Hong Kong makes my life a pure pleasure and complete with satisfaction. I hired the hotel Rolls Royce service which is a must because it is the best!!! The airport staff meet you at the gate with a sign and usually a motorized cart to whisk you thru the airport to customs...I am usually out of there within 10 minutes. The Phantom Rolls Royce is a signature of the hotel and so fabulous...It is worth the investment because it makes you feel like royalty...and it is the best way to start your visit to Hong Kong. DO IT!!!

arriving at the Peninsula Hong Kong is like arriving at my home away from home. Everything feels wonderful as soon as the beautiful glass doors are pushed open by one of the suited up door people... The scent of the lobby is fresh and familiar and the beautiful architecture is warm and friendly..

I love my morning breakfast buffett at the Verandah, best food and best service..they never miss a beat. Each of the staff pays close attention to my needs. The hotel concierge and the guest relations team go above and beyond to make my stay the best it can be, it truly is amazing.

The rooms are incredible, I like the first 5 floors facing Hong Kong Island. Fantastic electronics, wonderful bed and amazing and comfortable space in the room. there is no room i like better. I like the room 327, just because.

The spa is always a place I spend time, I had a wonderful two hour treatment called Peninsula time by Sarita who worked on me last trip. I also had a great massage by Pinky...both ladies are from Nepal

the front desk staff at the spa, Genevieve, Sumi and Anthony are the best of the best, always welcoming me back by name and making sure i am happy and comfortable....they bend over backwards to make sure my experience at the spa is unforgettable....and it works

i love the lobby restaurant for afternoon tea and light supper but they serve all day long and have ana amazing menu. the people watching is the best

the shopping arcade is beautiful but very fancy.

most important are all the people that make my stay so special, no particular order....Mateo at the front desk , who has been there for at least the last two years I ave been coming has the best customer service skills and professional and friendly...he always participates in my visits and making sure I am content

the concierge staff are all fantastic including Michael and Brian...both and the the others to make sure I am taken care of in any way possible...from arranging my train tickets to guangzhou to getting me a card to shipping packages home for me, can always count on the concierge staff to make my stay an incredible stay

last but not least...Alice Chan, head of Guest relations....this woman is incredible at her job. while the hotel is bustling with people and full of VIP guests, Alice chan always tends to my needs and her personal touches and thoughtfulness and professionalism are so amazing . I will NEVER stay anywhere else in Hong Kong because of the service and love i receive from Alice and the rest of the hotel...they make every effort to make sure you feel special and important and what can i say.??? this is my happy place...it is better than anything else i can think of in my travel history. NOTHING will beat this...i highly recommend the Peninsula Hong Kong, don't even think twice about your booking. you will NOT be disappointed"
555,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Best of the best ròckstar place,This hotel is amazing located in kowloon with shopping and dining walking distance the hotel and the staff are great old style beautiful design and service if you are in Hong Kong stay here you won't be disappointed transfer to the airport in one of the 12 rollers that takes going to the airport wow do it
556,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,"This is truly one of the best hotels in he world. It's very iconic and has a great view of Hong Kong island. The place is also very beautiful, and the customer service is top notch.

Once the doormen dressed in white open the doors for you, you are surrounded by lots of guests having high tea or meeting with clients. It's a good place to be seen.

Check in is around the corner to left and the staff was very professional and friendly. While checking in, they have an actual conversation with you that is warm and genuine. We arrived late at night and asked for restaurant recommendations.

We happen to be there during Mothers Day, so there were beautiful flowers everywhere. It was a nice sight to see and made the place smell really good.

The hallways leading to the rooms were so beautiful. Art is placed in the hallways to add to the ambiance, and the lighting is just right so it's not too dark to walk around.

The room itself was amazing. We had a small entry area that opened up to the main room. Everything in the room was controlled by a tablet - from opening the curtains, to turning on the lights - it was great. All the hotel information is also located on this tablet. There were also charging cords and international plug adapters located in drawers next to the bed. The bed also had a lot of comfortable pillows for a good nights rest.

The hallway leading to the restroom was lined by closets, and it even had a small valet where you could drop off laundry and the staff would take it without entering your room.

The restroom was beautiful. It was lined in marble, had two sinks, and the toilet and shower was separated. There was also a nice tub that had a built in television with a remote.

Breakfast in the second floor restaurant was very nice. The buffet had a great mix of Chinese and international foods. There were soups and omelette stations in the mix. Service was great here as well.

While the hotel and staff were outstanding, the icing on the cake was the chocolate Peninsula man greeting us when we entered our room. It looked so cute I didn't want to eat it."
557,Date of stay: July 2017,50,Flavour of old Hong Kong in modern business hotel.,"Best luxury hotel in Kowloon. Located in middle of the bustle of the commercial area the Peninsula has a mix of business and leisure travellers and find a way to make sure both have a great experience. Great restaurants and a concierge who can facilitate all logistics esp inside China. Rooms are very comfortable with lots of plugs and a very usable touch screen control panel for lighting, and all room functions. Really attentive staff who remember names of repeat guests....MTR subway station right outside...faster than taxis for travel to Hong Kong Island. 10-15 min to Central/IFC. Highly recommended."
558,Date of stay: July 2017,20,Very disappointing,"We were looking forward to staying at the hotel as a bit of a treat. We are leaving today after 3 days, very disappointed.
The hotel isn't welcoming or relaxing. The service and building just seem to have lost their soul.

The lobby is a circus every afternoon with people who are not staying at the hotel queuing to have high tea. The resulting decibels are far from pleasant.
There isn't really any other area where to seat and relax like a lounge or a library.

On our first day the neighbouring room was playing loud music and started again the following day at 7am. No one did anything about it.
The following night, staff knocked on our door in the middle of the night to replenish our coffee machine! The hotel provided chocolates as an apology the next day but in all our years of staying at 4 and 5 star hotels we've never had that problem! Wasn't expecting this from The Peninsula.

The young lady at the door for breakfast just jumps on you as soon as you arrive to get you room number with no other interaction. I'm not even sure she said hello. We were there for 3 days and she never acknowledged us.

The bar at Félix is poisonously expensive. The pool area is elegant and has a nice view but was overly air conditioned on our only visit.

On the plus side, the staff at reception is polite and friendly (the rest of the staff is distant as mentioned).

The buffet breakfast was also very nice. We chose not to eat in the lobby as we found that space very unpleasant, more akin to a shopping centre. A luxury one you might say but still not welcoming. The Veranda restaurant where the buffet is served is however a lovely space.

The room was elegant and well appointed.

In conclusion, save your pennies and stay somewhere else or if you just want to say you've been there, do like everyone else seems to, go for high tea in the lobby!"
559,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Perfect stay,"The three of us stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong last September (2016), before heading off to Singapore. The hotel was fantastic, with the hotel having such a well-known reputation for its service, being such a landmark in Hong Kong, I didn’t know if the hotel would live up to its reputation or not, but it most certainly did! The rooms we had were excellent, the beds were extremely comfy. The staff at the hotel are brilliant, in particular the staff at the Spring Moon restaurant which serves wonderful food. It was a pleasure to return to the Peninsula every evening, after a day of sightseeing. The location of the hotel was ideal, convenient to all central needs. Definitely thee hotel to stay at in Hong Kong, the Grande Dame of the East is still setting standards, after all this time! (Everything is done to perfection here)

Thank you for a wonderful stay."
560,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Beautiful hotel!,This hotel really is beautiful. The staff were extremely helpful and provided excellent service. We opted for the Rolls Royce pick up from the airport which was just what we needed after 30 hours of traveling. Convenient location for shopping on Nathan road and also within the hotel. The only minor downside for us was that most of our dinner reservations were on honk Kong island so each night we needed to leave at least 20 minutes before the reservation. Not a big deal but something to keep in mind.
561,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Afternoon Tea at it's best,The Peninsula Hotel has one of the best afternoon tea's in Hong Kong. The hotel l is completely elegant in every way. The afternoon tea is simply such a wonderful experience for all ages. The orchestra quartet plays above you setting such a relaxing atmosphere. Visit this iconic hotel for the ultimate afternoon tea experience!
562,Date of stay: August 2016,40,Good,"Been stayed with The Peninsula HK for three times already. However, the hotel never really give me a strong attractiveness and impressions after I left. But what attracted me to come back to stay here was that I don't need to queue for the high tea :)"
563,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Elegance defined.....,"The Flagship of the Peninsula Hotels, this graceful Beauty doesn't disappoint!...From the outrageous floral displays, to top-notch service in everything, from linens, to restaurants, etc...the Hotel is a bastion of refined hospitality...and worth every penny!
The breakfast buffet is world-class, as is every facet of this place...A place to experience, not just visit."
564,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Simply the Best,"If there is a better hotel anywhere in the world, I would like to see it. The location is great, the arcade shopping is the best, the lobby and reception are first rate, the bars and restaurants are top shelf, the rooms are modern and very elegant. All this, but what separates the hotel from other great hotels is the staff. The team simply takes customer service to the next level."
565,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Amazing stay,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and our stay was incredible.
-Welcome experience and airport pick up was efficient and comfortable, and staff were extremely friendly, check-in was in the room.
-Staff service was great everywhere.
-Room was beautiful - everything is well thought out, with great layout, great adjustable lighting and comfortable bed. We had a beautiful view of the harbor.
-Wi-fi was extremely fast and easy to connect!
-Restaurants were delicious (breakfast buffet has everything you want, Chinese restaurant is great, Felix is nice at night, the bar has great ambiance.
-Pool is nice and relaxing
-Concierge was very helpful giving us with directions to various places
-Location is extremely convenient - getting anywhere is very easy by subway, taxi, ferry."
566,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Outstanding Deluxe Experience,"We have just spent 5 wonderful nights at the Peninsula. The luxury, attention to detail, quality and service were all outstanding. Clearly, it is very expensive but worth it for a special holiday. I recommend that if you have booked room only that you ask them on check-in to quote you for bed and breakfast. Breakfast is a beautiful relaxing experience and you wont be hungry until evening !!! The incremental cost per day to switch to B&B was HK$450 for TWO people but if you just went for breakfast a la carte, then it was circa HK$830 for two. Have the afternoon tea. We also dined at Felix - fabulous views and cocktail bar. Food was only average and very expensive for what you got - you were paying a lot for the wonderful view of the HK skyline"
567,Date of stay: June 2017,50,The Garden Suite private function area,"An Extraordinary space. The private, elegant, indoor dining area opens up on to a large terrace with sublime views of Hong Kong Island and Victoria Harbour. We attended a birthday party and was blown away by the service, quality and presentation of food, ambience and views."
568,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Amazing Hotel,"This was our first stop on a four week trip across South Asia. From the moment we were met at the aircraft air bridge to the moment we were chauffeured back to the airport the service care and attention we received was outstanding. My wife had developed a dental problem on the flight and by the time we arrived at the hotel (by a wonderful Rolls Royce) the Penisula had arranged a dentist for her. After a efficient in suite check in a hotel security member escorted us across town to the dentist and throughout the 3 night stay the staff continued to check how my wife was including sending complimentary rice to the room when she was struggling to eat. The hotel itself was fantastic, our room being smart controlled by iPads. The restaurant, pool and lobby excluded class and despite my wife's illness we had a amazing stay. Thank you to all the staff that made the start to our trip so wonderful"
569,Date of stay: June 2017,50,Stress just Melts Away,"God how I love the Peninsula Hong Kong. I've been fortunate in being able to stay here several times for several days at a time.

This time around after a very stressful couple of months, I can simply say that just walking into the Peninsula saw my stress level just melt away.

As per usual, the staff were fantastic from the moment we checked in with Josie (Reception). Our room 2501 was beautiful, extremely clean with everything a guest would possibly want. The bed oh the bed, I sank into that within 10 minutes of arrival sheer bliss.

My partner was in the Spa getting a treatment after a 10 hour flight, I didn't see her for a couple of hours and when she came back she was bouncing, no jet lag effect here thank you.

The service by all at the hotel was truly excellent. We got outstanding service in the Verandah where we ate breakfast daily (thank you so much Sam). The food is first class, plenty of it and plenty of variety. Our tip is to give yourself at least an hour to enjoy the food and get your day off to a flying start. Dinner in the Verandah was no different, a fantastic variety that we enjoyed several times. We also enjoyed dining in our room, again the food delivered was excellent.

If you want to people watch, well you can't beat sitting in the Lobby and watching the world go by. Again the service was brilliant, we had for the first time the wonderful Peninsula Afternoon Tea, which really does fill you up.

The Peninsula Pool is a great place just to chill out and maybe have a dip. So too is the Bar (just down from the Verandah), Sam the barman makes some fantastic cocktails.

As with all things, the good times must end, we checked out with the wonderful assistance of Henry, who made it an absolute breeze and rather regretful too in that we were leaving a hotel that we consider to be part of our family.

We'll be back, of that we can assure."
570,Date of stay: June 2017,30,Time for a Shake Up,"An old fashioned dame is a sucker for a hotel with a rich history and a name. The Peninsula Hong Kong is the original in the Peninsula hotel group and synonymous with glamour, romance, luxury.
Overall the service is very good and the comfort of the hotel room is excellent. We opted for a room one step up from standard with city views.
The room boasted lots of great gadgets and control temperature, curtains, lights, audio from iPads on both sides of the bed. The bed and linen and pillows were deliciously comfortable- no complaints there whatsoever. We enjoyed three very good sleeps across the three nights we stayed.
The size of the bathroom is great and array of oscar de la renta toiletries really good. The green and black marble though was so garish that one might be fooled into thinking a quarry on the mainland was having a fire sale at time of renovation.
The lighting in the bathroom was really poor - what is it with hotels and poorly lit bathrooms?- although there was an additional table and mirror/light set up for the ""laydees"" to do their make up. I did not join that exclusive coterie.
Another drawer near the desk revealed all sorts of stationery products. Multiple chargers including both sides of the bed made it impossible to avoid responding to that important business email.
However the aesthetics of the hotel fell down on so many counts. There was the most horrendous wall decoration of a style and size that beggars belief. How about simple timeless wood panelling instead? I could not bear to look at it long enough to photograph, dear reader, so alas cannot share with you first hand on this account.
The layout and amenities of the hotel are poor. The lobby and reception layout is clunky and ugly. My eyes are still watering.
The poor layout and flawed flow of traffic and limited areas for hotel guests to enjoy cool drinks and escape the daily onslaught of afternoon tea tourists in the lobby is disappointing to say the least.
Dear Owner of the Peninsula, I have many interior designer friends who could work with you to create a timeless and elegant hotel keeping true to your history and colonial values. Feel free to contact me.
And I haven't arrived at the crux of the issue: the price. My husband and I have stayed at many hotels around the world. We feel that the Peninsula is the most outrageously priced hotel that we have ever experienced. Other reviewers who wax lyrical do not, I suggest, get around very often. We have paid considerably more for hotels in the past and have been very satisfied. Unfortunately where the Peninsula is concerned we feel dismayed and disappointed. The fact that I'm spending half an hour on my holiday writing this is a testament to this.
If a hotel is about welcoming guests and generous hospitality, then the Peninsula has a lot to learn and cannot continue to trade on its old school reputation.
We paid more than $800 a night and with that received free wi-fi, the pressing of two garments daily, and - listen up here- breakfast for one. That is right: one guest. We needed to remind the cheerful chap at reception to credit us for three breakfasts when finalising the bill.
The breakfast in the Lounge was good but we were not even told where breakfast was located when we checked in. We had breakfast in the lobby the first two mornings not realising that there is the buffet breakfast in another area. The breakfast in the lobby was sub- standard to say the least. We joked at what Gordon Ramsay would say- and do with it.
Please read my yet to be penned review of the one Michelin star restaurant in the Peninsula- Spring Moon.
Please Messrs Owners of the Peninsula- email me- I have countless suggestions for improvement. Your hotel needs a monumental shake up."
571,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Outstanding,"Everything about our stay at this wonderful hotel was fantastic. From the personal greeting at the airport, the Rolls Royce transfers, the in-room check-in - our introduction to the hotel was wonderful. And the excellent standard continued throughout our stay. Service is friendly and personal. Food at breakfast and dinner was outstanding. And our room, with its amazing views of the harbour, was fabulous. Incredibly comfortable bed and every amenity you could think of. Can't wait to go back!!"
572,Date of stay: March 2017,50,One word 'Outstanding ',"Having completed an almost round the world trip, it meant staying in many places, after a horrendous experience in another place we moved to the Peninsula. Cheap it was not, but it was worth every penny.

From the minute we walked in, bearing in mind we had only booked an hour before arriving we were greeted by very professional check in staff who spoke excellent English.

Shown a couple of room choices. We settled on one.

All amenities were of very good quality, the cleanliness was 10/10

We had our own butler.

We had a choice of eating in different areas including breakfast.
Both were excellent.

The breakfast area on the 1st floor was the buffet but main courses were served. I have never experienced such professionalism but discreet service. If you left your table to get anything by the time you walked back your napkin was folded any unwanted plates cutlery gone. But all done without you being aware of it.

In the mornings the roof top swimming pool was surperb, clean high up fab views and because it was early 7am empty, I love that.

The hotel is located very centrally. Very easy to get the ferry or go shopping.

Afternoon tea appeared to be a must as every day there were queues. However as a guest of the hotel we were always seated. The China it was served on was perfect. All correctly served.

I absolutely loved this place, it was fairly Art Deco in style and retains its class along with the best staff I have come across.

Well done.

I loved it.

Would I go again Yes
Would I recommend 100% Yes

Thank you Peninsula"
573,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Excellent stay.,"From the greeting at the airport, the Rolls Royce transfer and the room upgrade you are made to feel welcomed and valued. Our check-in (completed in the room) was seemless. The room was ready when we arrived, so after a shower and change, we were ready to meet our friend in the hotel lobby. Out around town by 1pm. The hotel and rooms are excellent and the staff are superb. Not cheap but worth every dollar. We stayed as part of our 25th wedding anniversary tour and with the champagne and chocolates we were made to feel very special."
574,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Very nice,"This is so far the best hotel I've stayed in Hong Kong.

What I liked:
- quick check-in/check-out
- the pool with a great view of HK island
- the fitness center
- the afternoon tea at the lobby
- the room
- exceptional service (especially Mr Dupont)

We plan to stay here again."
575,Date of stay: May 2017,50,What a Luxury Hotel Should Be!,"From the Rolls Royce transport from the airport, to the superb cuisine at Gaddi's, to the incredible friendliness and helpfulness of every staff member we encountered, to the high-tech wirelessly controlled and superbly decorated and appointed rooms, the Peninsula, under the leadership of GM Rainy Chan, is the epitome of what a luxury hotel should be. And the history and location, both incredible, simply add to the pleasure. Superb in every way! Thank you, Rainy and your crew for a marvelous stay!"
576,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Top notch experience,"The service is really very special, kind, with the staff look for minimum details. Congrats for the management ! The room we stayed at 4th floor was renewed, beautiful, very pleasing, comfortable, and with a set of hi-tech controls (may a little too much) with ipads, and ""touch"" controls in every single possible corner.
Nevertheless they payed attention to everything, each drawer with a unexpected service (having even a printer in the desk), Nespresso etc. Extra points for the kindness of housekeeping always gentil and available. Food is very good, at buffet breakfast and Felix restaurant (nice view). Oh, the pool and SPA are also how it needs to be. Its a top 5 star hotel, one of the best we've been around the world."
577,Date of stay: May 2017,10,HK icon in an unbeatable KL location. Tragic failure in service recovery...,"I've been to the Peninsula many times for meals and frequented the fabulous spa when I lived in Hong Kong but have never stayed at the hotel. The Four Seasons is my usual choice when visiting given its convenient location in Central and comfortable rooms. On this recent trip however I decided to try the iconic Peninsula as I had no engagements requiring me to be in Central.

Good:
- Great bellmen. Efficient and courteous and always happy to assist.
- In-room technology: Very well-integrated technology and things worked well. Too many hotels these days have fancy bedside tablets that simply do not work.
- Bedding: Fantastic. Had a great night of sleep and loved the Quagliotti sheets.
- Room was clearly finished to a high standard and many customized details / furniture pieces (e.g. sofa with its built-in coasters, mini-bar cabinet...etc)

Meh:
- Check-in formalities took at least 10 minutes. Asked for a king bed but was given a twin room as they were full. That's totally fine, but subsequent conversations with management revealed that they could easily convert the beds from twin to king at turn down. Why wasn't this option offered at check in?
- Some wear and tear in the room. Stained leather and chipped wood. But in general maintenance was acceptable.

Bad:
- I came back to the room past midnight and found it unbearably hot. The AC was set to 18C but the room did not cool down even after half an hour. I called and asked for a room attendant / engineering to come look at the AC for me.
- A knock on the door five minutes later and a housekeeping staff showed up and literally asked ""what's the problem,"" and proceeded to stomp towards the AC touch panel to turn it off and on again. He then looked at me as if I was stupid and asked ""is this better."" There was clearly no cold air coming out so I asked him to get engineering.
- I was shocked by the attendant's rudeness and called the manager on duty (Nicola) who was professional and apologized on behalf of his staff. While we were speaking, the same housekeeping staff came into my room without knocking and showed up with engineering then left without saying a word. Nicola was made aware of this and he promised to relay the incident to the FOM (Matteo) in the morning and said Matteo will meet me and follow-up at check out.
- Fast forward to 3pm the next day: I checked out and the front desk staff apologized but zero response from Matteo (in-person or written). If the front desk staff was aware of the incident it's clear this incident was mentioned at their morning briefing, but I guess as a first-time, one-night guest I was not worthy of an actual response from Matteo even though they proactively offered to follow-up.

I wouldn't have left with such a bad impression if they did not promise to follow-up. But just don't over promise and under deliver..."
578,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Outstanding!,From the moment you are greeted at the covered portico the staff at the Peninsula make you feel welcome. This hotel is charm personified! We loved it! A long leisurely breakfast on the verandah is the perfect start to the day. Of course High Tea is another not to be missed experience and as a hotel guest you jump the queue (which is ridiculously long). I can't wait to go back!
579,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Still Excellent,We always at the Peninsula when in Hong Kong. We prefer the original building because of the atmosphere. All rooms are clean and up to date with all of the latest electronic amenities. The service is impeccable especially in the Verandah breakfast room.
580,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Peninsula-- the best option in HK!,"I looked at a lot of luxury hotel options in Hong Kong and was really having a hard time choosing. Which side of the harbor should we stay on? Will we miss something important if we stay on the wrong side? The Peninsula was definitely the correct choice. We had a suite on the 19th floor, overlooking the harbor and it was spectacular! From the moment we arrived in Hong Kong, the Peninsula staff took amazing care of us. We were picked up at our gate and escorted through the airport, through customs and had our bags collected. They were then loaded into the Rolls Royce car that we arranged as a transfer. While a bit excessive, it was a perfect arrival, and really set the stage for our stay. Check in was completed in our room, as was a brief tour of the room and it's many amenities. Everything from perfectly wired sound systems, lighting, smart draperies, and more. The room had a beautiful sofa, desk, large dressing area, spacious bedroom with vanity and beautiful bathroom. The bathroom has a separate tub and shower and 2 sinks. Every day the room was maintained perfectly. The lobby has incredibly flower arrangements and really makes you feel like you are staying somewhere spectacular, which you are. The area was easily navigable to all the major attractions and markets. We never had a hard time getting over to the other side of the harbor if needed. Overall, I would highly recommend this gorgeous hotel!"
581,Date of stay: February 2017,50,A great hotel!!!,"We stayed at this property in February 2017 and I must say it truly offers a five star stay. The rooms are beautiful and new and you get a sense that the hotel is very clean which helps you relax and feel like home. Although we normally stay on the island side when travelling to Hong Kong, the peninsular is very well located as both the metro and the ferries are very close by. On the down side of the hotel is the extremely busy lobby due to tourists coming in and waiting to be seated for the famous afternoon tea and also tourista come flooding in just because they concider this hotel a tourist attraction. I think that the management ought to do something about this in order to control the number of people coming in. Also the breakfast buffet servd although is of high quality it lacks in variaty and if one is travelling with children this can be a problem.
All in all though this is a beautiful, clean and extensively modernized hotel that is worth staying at when visiting Hong Kong."
582,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Gorgeous Hotel,"My husband had been traveling for a month when I met him in Hong Kong. I got there a day earlier and as excited as I was to see him, I selfishly enjoyed arriving to the hotel first. Though I got in late (almost midnight), the staff checked me in quickly and my bags were delivered immediately, as was tea service in my room.

The bathtub had a tv in it (one of my favorite features of nice hotels), but better yet was the ""spa"" button that dimmed the lights, played relaxing music and automatically set the ""privacy please"" function.

The rooms are tastefully done and the technology is outstanding. Lots of outlets and charging ports for devices and the VOIP with free international calls is a lovely touch. I used it to call the States and brag about the room.

The airport transfers (Rolls Royce) were lovely and all the Staff were top notch. We attended a function in one of the event rooms. The food was excellent though the waitstaff were a little inexperienced. They kept trying to take plates away while you were eating. The room was beautiful.

Not a bad thing to say about the hotel, only that my visit was too short."
583,Date of stay: May 2017,40,Good stay at the Peninsula on our first visit to Hong Kong,"I booked the Peninsula through the American Express Fine Hotels & Resorts program and arranged for a Rolls Royce pickup at the airport through the hotel. This was the best airport pickup hands down! We were escorted as we left the plane with staff representing the hotel, for our baggage pickup, and right to the Rolls Royce for transfer to the hotel. My wife and I felt like celebrities and I highly recommend people try this at least once. The Peninsula is beautiful hotel and we enjoyed the amenities the hotel had to offer such as high tea in the lobby and the beautiful pool which is well run by the staff working there. The only regret I have is not getting a complimentary upgrade as I have usually experienced on using my American Express Platinum and because it was my wife and my 10th anniversary. The last hotel on our tour upgraded us two levels as an example; I realize that room upgrades are not always possible so will not fault the hotel too much for this. Overall a wonderful stay in a hotel that offers one of the finest experiences in Hong Kong - highly recommended."
584,Date of stay: May 2017,50,My favorite hotel chain IN THE WORLD.,"In my position I travel the world staying at various hotel chains at all budget levels. For the 5 - 6 star category, The Peninsula Hotels are definitely my pick for No.1. The painstaking effort placed on delivering excellent customer service is blatantly obvious. The extraordinary long tenure of their staff who are more like family than colleagues enables a warmth clearly felt by most if not all customers. The hotels themselves are constructed of and include the very best materials, silky soft sheets forever without wrinkles to hand crafted wallpaper, deeply stained and superbly lacquered wood, top of line carpeting, lighting to cater for every mood. All rooms have a discreetly hidden state of the art ""user friendly"" fax, printer, scanner. This coupled with the high end VOIP service enables business travellers the benefit of an instant office the moment you step in the room These are luxury hotels and don't disappoint, the Hong Kong Peninsula is my home away from home!"
585,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Scratch one off my Bucket List!,"From the Rolls pickup at the airport to afternoon tea in the lobby, our stay was a wonderful experience. The staff, amenities, location, shopping, decor are all exceptional. And, our room was amazing ... the perfect home away from home! We'd gladly stay here again and again and again."
586,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Happy holiday,"This review base on my trip to HK few years ago , I have stayed at this hotel twice , the entrance Lobby was so eyes catching very high ceiling with crystal chandelier , this hotel is one of top 5 stars hotel in HK few years ago ! I love high tea at this hotel , Cantonese restaurant was so good , nice food beautiful restaurant with great service , I remembered room was a bit small and didn't look that great not sure if they had up-grade or re- furnish the furniture , bathroom a bit small too but most hotel in HK not big if it's a standard room ! Except 4 Seasons Hotel that hotel was exceptional !
Overall Peninsula is a great hotel great location 👍👍! Easy access close to shopping and heaps more restaurant around !"
587,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Amazing hotel in Hong Kong,"I can't say enough good things about this hotel.. the location, the amenities, the staff, the rooms, the decor were all absolutely amazing. One thing about this hotel that we have not experienced elsewhere was being able to control the room with an iPad, such as the lights, window shades, etc. This was a fun bonus! High tea was also delicious."
588,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Exceptional in every way,This is a dreamy hotel: spectacular harbour views; superb restaurants and dining; outstanding rooms; high-end shopping arcades; personable and highly attentive staff. The food and service are top-notch. You will never have to leave unless you want to chopper out for the views. The Peninsula is Hong Kong!
589,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Perfection,"We have stayed in top hotels around the world, but for our money the Peninsula in Hong Kong tops the list. From the moment they met us at the airport until they delivered us at the dock to board our cruise ship, the service was impeccable. The location is superb. Great restaurants on property, and afternoon tea in the lobby should not be missed (reservations accepted from hotel guests, so no standing in line). This was our second visit, and we will never consider another hotel when in the city."
590,Date of stay: March 2017,40,Beautiful BUT...,"This hotel is lovely and luxurious through and through. Beautiful architecture and decor; amenity-rich rooms; Rolls Royce airport pickup (we loved our friendly and informative driver, Denny); and striking views from the pool and restaurant Felix. Our only real disappointment was that any time we asked for restaurant recommendations, we were always referred to in-hotel restaurants, and while Felix had gorgeous views, we did not want to come to Hong Kong to eat at a French restaurant. We would have appreciated some local suggestions outside of the hotel, because we came to Hong Kong to explore the city itself!"
591,Date of stay: May 2017,40,Not the traditional afternoon tea-disappointing!,"I have been to the Peninsula lobby for afternoon tea a few times. With recent assault of mainland tourists thirsty for a taste of this very British tradition, not only long queues is formed, they changed the traditional tea set into a modern version to include these fancy little French tartlets and mini quiches! Where are the pastries, the smoke salmon sandwiches, the egg & crest sandwiches? Thank goodness they kept the scones and cucumber sandwiches! Lol!
In addition to this slight disappointment, one of the waitresses was rather rude to one of my customers when she asked for the direction of the toilet! Not the Peninsula service standard I used to know.
Amongst all the over priced ""fake"" afternoon teas in this city, the Peninsula is still one of the handful good places that offers a ""half"" traditional British afternoon tea in a very traditional environment which is also very important too."
592,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Heaven on earth,"I can't remember a better hotel experience--they met us as we left the gate--promptly got us to a car and whisked us to the most beautiful hotel with smiles all around. From concierge, to the bartender at The Bar, to front desk and bell staff--service was perfect. Great shopping in the hotel and high tea that looks sinful. Great location as well. A must do. It is worth the investment."
593,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Excellent trip! Excellent hotel,"Five stars all the way. This absolutely stunning hotel excels in every way. From the luxurious decor, posh interior, the cleanliness to the location of the hotel. The room is about 40 sq.meter with huge closet space. It is equipped with hi-tech equipment but they make it really easy to use. The pool is a must try at least once during visit

The service is beyond excellent, given such a large hotel I don't know how they managed to be so efficient and so thoughtful. We traveled as a family and the hotel prepared very nice children amenities for our little girl, she loved it! Concierge team and the bell staffs are super nice, as well as restaurant staffs in the lobby

We booked a Rolls Royce pick-up and drop-off and that was the experience in itself! During drop-off the Peninsula staff waited to carry luggages and check-in for us.

The Sunday brunch at the Verandah is excellent as well.

Worth every penny!!"
594,Date of stay: May 2017,30,Past it's Prime,"I was disappointed in the Peninsula. My room was small with no view, with renovations taking place within the near vicinity of my room.
The restaurants were particularly disappointing. The lobby restaurant looks beautiful but the food was poor quality. The roof top restaurant was equally disappointing. The lamb fillet was lukewarm and over cooked in pastry.

In summary the hotel was overrated and over priced."
595,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Brunch,This is probably the best hotel i have been to. I have been going since The 1960s it has never lost it's quality of service the food is exquisite the staff are with out doubt the most polite and helpful.i can not say enough about this hotel you have to see for yourself you will not be disappointed in any way.
596,Date of stay: May 2017,50,Quick stopover,What can one say about this grand old hotel in Kowloon? Great staff and amenities. Good location in Kowloon if you don't want to stay on the island which is only a short train ride or ferry ride away. We had a harbor view room which was amazing but the bar on the 28th floor does have great views of the harbor. Nathan Road is just around the corner and so is the Tsim Sha Tsui station. The pool area was also a great place to have a cup of coffee or a simple breakfast before the day starts.
597,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Fabulous stay,"The Peninsula is a superb, luxury hotel with a perfect location in Hong Kong.
It is a bit expensive but it is really worth it. The staff is impeccable and very kind and responsive.
I had an excellent stay, in a very spacious and comfortable room, and excellent food both at breakfast and dinner. The SPA is one of the best I visited. I really enjoyed my stay and I hope to visit again."
598,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Two words.... A-mazing!!,"Great hotel located in the ""older"" side of HK. I like it better because it's quieter and has more of a ""Chinese"" feel once you go exploring. The new side is what you would see in a cosmopolitan area (like New York). The service is top notch and the hotel grounds is gorgeous! The spa is a must. Pretty reasonable and intimate. Over looks the Bay Area"
599,Date of stay: June 2016,50,A tale of 2 hotels - Part 1,"Hong Kong is one of our favorite cities and the Peninsula rates as one of our top hotels. This is a brief comparison of The Pen and its neighbor The Sheraton Hong Kong. The experience at The Pen begins upon arrival at the airport. We were greeted by a Peninsula rep as we departed the jetway. Carry on bags were taken and we were escorted to a private cart for the journey to Immigration / Customs. The process was smooth and fast thanks to our ""handler"". Once thru we were handed off to another Peninsula rep - the man in the striped pants - who took us to baggage claim and then to our incredible Rolls Royce transfer to the hotel. Pricey yes, but worth the money for this experience. The ride in was quick, smooth and pleasant. We were greeted as we exited the Limo and whisked to our room for an early check in. The room was graciously decorated but a little bit to much dark lacquer for our taste. Fruit and tea were waiting our arrival. Breakfast each room was taken on the 8th floor pool deck overlooking the Harbor - absolutely perfect!! During, we never saw a housekeeping person or cart in the hallway. There was never a room service tray outside a room. Everything was incredibly discreet. Afternoons can be spent in the Lobby for Tea - a string quartet plays classical music from a balcony above the Lobby. Our only ""off"" observation was the very long line of non Hotel guests snaking down the corridor in front of the elevators. A distraction but easily remedied by using the opposite end elevator. Impeccable service in an incredible location! See Part 2 for a comparison"
600,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Staff speak english very well and warm hospitality,"I enjoy the shoping arcade of this hotel with some private shop of Dior, Cartier etc.. they also provide a classic english way in serving tea. Very british style and the staff really helpful to explain how is the city and how to reach another place. I will come back to stay in this hotel"
601,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Who could ask for more?,We had an impromptu lunch in the lobby bar restaurant of this impressive historical hotel. Red curry BBQ duck for me and a seared tuna salad for my partner both absolutely delicious. The service was exemplary. Great place to people watch! The chamber music was just sublime. Who could ask for more?
602,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Favourite hotel on the planet!!,"I've stayed in some of the best hotels around the world but The Peninsula HK is my all time favourite !!! I love it so much I cry every time I have to leave!
It may be to do with my love of Hong Kong itself and my family there but The Peninsula is special, it's history gives it something the other hotels in HK don't have. The staff couldn't be better, they are always so friendly and happy to help. The in-room facilities are the best I've ever seen... even better than Tokyo! The views from the harbour view rooms are also just magical too!!
The location being in TST is perfect, I love being on Kowloon side because it's more local. A short ferry ride will take you to Island side . Plus you get the better view!! It's also basically connected to the MTR ... so travel is so convenient!
If you're looking for somewhere to stay in HK then this is the only place! It has such personality as well as being up to date, modern and convenient!!
Can't wait to return!! Last trip was a year ago and I'll be back in 4 weeks time!"
603,Date of stay: March 2017,50,A Grand Old Lady of the East,We stayed at the Peninsular after having been meet at the Airport and transferred to the Hotel by our Rolls Royce vehicle which was magnificent. After all it was our 5oth Wedding Anniversary celebration. We have stayed at the Pen a couple of times in the past and it always has that way about greeting guests and providing wonderful accommodation. A surprise this time each room has VOIP to enable guest to call anywhere in the world without cost - it was a great facility. We enjoyed our suite for the five day visit to our favourite Hotel
604,Date of stay: April 2017,20,"A hit or miss, very inconsistent service","I have such a long review coming soon, but for now this is all I can muster...

The service is inconsistent and some of the staff borderline aggressive.

Once I get home, I will pen down our experience and detail it our for everyone here.

Needles to say the company I work for will no longer stay at this hotel during business

trips, thanks to my experience as a private person here."
605,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Favorite,We always stay here when we're in the city. The rooms and the service is great and top of the line. We always use the spa here as well and has always been a pleasant experience. I recommend this place for anyone who wants to relax away from the city life.
606,Date of stay: April 2017,50,It does not get better than this,"We have been staying at this hotel for many years now, and they still manage to surprise and delight us with their attention to detail and standard of service. This hotel has service mastered. No ask is too big or too small. We always leave wanting to come back. From the moment you meet your escort through airport formalities to the Rolls Royce transfer you are enveloped in the Peninsula service.
Hong Kong is such an exciting and frenetic city and the hotel is always a blissful retreat. We stayed in room 526, beautiful but firm king size bed, with lovely view of the harbour. A smallish room with not a great deal of space for storing luggage. Fabulous marble bathroom and separate toilet; all the amenities you could want. the coffee machine has been a great addition with the room renovations the hotel completed a couple of years ago. The hotel has great dining options; Felix being our favourite for its spectacular views fro the top of the hotel and its always amazing food."
607,Date of stay: April 2017,40,Very gracious hotel,We stayed here for several nights. The hotel is centrally located near all transportation and excellent shopping. If you are looking for an authentic feel unfortunately you won't find it at the peninsula. The hotel is much like you'd find in any very big city. It's very international in terms of the offerings. I wish it was more Chinese. We were looking forward to that. However we found Hong Kong in general to be very much like other big cities. You have to get off the main streets to feel like a real visitor. Back to the peninsula ... staff are very accommodating. The spa is beautiful. The veranda restaurant is a pretty location for breakfast.
608,Date of stay: March 2017,50,"An exceptional stay, perfect in every way!","Our family thoroughly enjoyed a luxurious, friendly and impressive stay at this very fine property mid March, 2017. The Peninsula is centrally located and close to all public transport. Every experience - front door ""page boys & girls"", front desk, guest relations, dining, house keeping, airport transfers and concierge exceed our expectations (which were very high because of the cost!). The views from our corner suite across to Hong Kong island and back over Kowloon were spectacular. The suite was spacious, light filled and the decor, although understated, was elegant. Most importantly the service across the entire hotel was consistent and impeccable. I highly recommend the ""Chef's Table"" in the kitchen - one of the most unique dinning experiences we have ever had. We also dined in Felix, The Lobby and with Room Service - all very good. My past stays in HK have been at The InterContinental (for the Club Lounge and absolute water location) but this time I chose to treat our family and try The Peninsula. The views are equally spectacular and the amazing service will not disappoint - it is worth every cent!"
609,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Honeymoon heaven,"Stayed here for our honeymoon in 2015 and the hotel, facilities, staff and services were amazing. We upgraded our room for a harbor view room for the last 2 nights and the room was spectacular. We did have a small issue though as there were some ants on the desk area. We alerted staff who immediately addressed the problem and for the inconvenience relocated us to a suite for the remainder of our stay. We also used the Rolls Royce transfer both ways which was well worth the money! If you're looking for one of those experiences you'd talk about later I'd recommend staying here."
610,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Afternoon tea,A must when you visit Hongkong it is first come first served we waited an hour but it was worth the wait the quartet played classical music and lala land just heaven .The afternoon tea was beautiful with sandwiches cakes tea coffee and we had cocktails to finish a perfect afternoon
611,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Perfect Vacation,Great location. The rooms were elegant and the staff could not have been better. Great choices for dining at the hotel. Our favorite was a true Swiss Chalet which put out the best fondue we have had in many years. The breakfast buffet was one of the best I have ever experienced. This hotel deserves its number one reputation. We stayed five nights. The spa and pool were wonderful.
612,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Absolutely wonderful!,"We had the best experience at this fantastic hotel. Excellent service, totally professional service oriented staff and beyond all expectations for any hotel. We have stayed in some of the finest hotels in Europe and North America, but this hotel and the staff set a standard that few can meet! Would stay here again! Thank you!"
613,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Perfect location in Kowloon,"Excellent hotel in the perfect spot for views across the harbour, and steeped in history. Impeccable service. We stayed for 3 nights in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View room, which was excellent. Spacious, full of up to date technology (even the curtains closed at the present of a button). iPads are provided to operate everything."
614,Date of stay: April 2017,50,Possibly the best urban hotel in the world?,"I had occasion to stay twice there within the last couple of weeks. A few items. First, the last time I was there (in 2016) I noted on TripAdvisor that the pool was 1-2 degrees too warm for laps. The manager responded on TripAdvisor that they would look into this...and indeed for this trip, the pool temp was indeed 1-2 degrees lower and just right for laps, just as he had promised.

The rooms are, as all Peninsulas, exceedingly comfortable and quiet, with industry-leading technology. When you check in, they give you a tea service, with top-flight teas. Along with that, a package of 4 chocolates. Now, maybe I don't get out enough, but these could be the best chocolates in the world. I ended up buying a bunch more at their boutique for gifts.

Since I was traveling alone both times, I ordered room service, which was a ""bargain"" as compared to other 5-star hotels, with a wide assortment of Asian and Western items, which you can order half servings of, to increase variety. The breakfast at the Verandah is also an outstanding value, assuming you eat enough.

My only complaint was that during my first stay, the temp did not cool to 18 C as claimed on the thermostat and when I asked to have the temp lowered the next day because it wasn't right, I got some pushback. The second stay was just fine, temp-wise.

The only reason not to stay here would be that most of the cool stuff is in Hong Kong. This hotel is on Kowloon Island, which means to go pretty much anywhere you need to get on the MTR."
615,Date of stay: March 2017,50,OMG What service and great Kowloon location,"This hotel and our room were amazing. Great location right outside of the Tsim Sha Shui MTR station entrance off of Nathan Road. The service throughout the hotel was amazing. Our room was in the 'old' original building but there was nothing old about our room with state of the art electronic controls for everything imaginable. Huge room, comfortable bed, helpful concierge staff. The free internet phone connection back to US was really nice. Our plan included free breakfast buffet and it was really impressive. Good gym but even better sauna and steam to relax after hectic day being a tourist"
616,Date of stay: March 2017,40,Pleasant stay marred by experience at The Lobby,"My family of 3, my sister and father and ,myself took up 2 rooms, adjoining, room 2617 & 2618 for 3 nights at the Pen HK recently. I would say the rooms were loverly, well appointed and very scenic as we booked the harbourview tower rooms. We dined exclusively at the Pen, for all our meals, at the Spring Moon several times and the Verandah once and had afternoon tea at the Lobby once. Most of our dining experience was wonderful. Unfortunately, on our last day, we decided to have a leisurely paced early lunch at the lobby as we booked a hotel limousine at 1 pm to the airport. We went down just before 11.30 and were seated and order at 11.30 am. It took 1/2 hour for our soups to arrive and that was after asking about our food twice. After the soup finally came, it took another 15 minutes before my sister's and father's burgers to arrive, again after asking the service staff to hurry up with the food order. It did arrive, around 12.15 pm but my sandwich was missing. I told my sister and father to start with their food and I waited for another 5 minutes....my sandwich was no where in sight. I got fed up and went to complaint at their service counter and as I was giving them a piece of my mind, my sandwich arrived. I was no longer in the mood to eat ashy 'leisurely' lunch was totally spoilt by the excessive delay of the food service at the Lobby. I made formal complaint in letter immediately and handed the letter to the reception counter to give to their General Manager, Rainy Chan. I also asked to speak to the Duty Manager who apologised and took the bill off my tab.

It was not so much the bill but this episode has marred by entire experience at the Peninsula. otherwise perfect to that point.I have stayed in many 5 starred properties around the world and for the flagship Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong to be having these food service hiccups in a time that is not busy, is totally unacceptable. Having had food service industry experience before, I could have easily whipped up the soups ""French Onion"" and ""Wild Mushroom"" from scratch in less than 1/2 hour with the mise en place in place. There is obviously a slip up either in the kitchen or the service staff at the Lobby. A Japanese lady took our order at the Lobby.

We will return to Hong Kong in mid May, and we will be staying over the The Landmark Mandarin Oriental. another favourite hotel of ours."
617,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Little changed,"Dropped in for a drink after watching the harbour light show Given that the last time we were there was in the 70s it was pleasing to find all the old elegance, charm and professional staff The decor is beautiful and you feel like you have been transported back in time. On return will head straight to the chocolate shop"
618,Date of stay: March 2017,40,Good but could have been better Room 2716,"Grand Luxury Hotels booked my reservation for the Peninsula. This was to celebrate my 59th Birthday, boy it looked like all of Hong Kong celebrated also with the nightly light show visible from our room in The Harbor. I received a double upgrade for this room and the third night was free which was cut short because we had a 12 midnight flight. But there was no short cuts on room 2716 the view was priceless the room was a bedroom suite that was about 1700 SF huge by Hong Kong Standards. All the lights, temp,blinds were controlled by an iPad type device that controlled everything btw it was 1 1/2 baths in the suite with two mini bar units one in the BR one in the dining room. The bathroom was marble floor to ceiling along with the tub and shower with its body jets. There was a dressing area,safe, drawers and wooden hangers. His and her sinks and glass doors are in front of the shower area and water closet area. Half of the bathroom is a wall of windows with remote controlled blinds controlling the view. The Harbor Side of the room from the Liv Rm,Din Rm and bedroom is a wall of windows facing Victoria Harbor a beautiful site 24 hours a day.
Room Service, Housekeeping anything in relation to the suite was world class and Perfect. Perfect is fast,professional and exceeds my expectations.
When we checked in it was coming off of a 2 week Asian Cruise so we arrived at 11am ,the hotel transfer was waiting for me with a name sign as soon as we left the ship and a porter was selected who loaded our Van for the short trip to the Hotel we were given a cool towel and water for our trip.
Since our room wasn't ready we were able to secure one of the hotels fleet of mini coopers and the driver Ricki who took us on a 3 hour tour of Hong Kong and even took me to pick up some Cigars at a local shop! It was great he took us to Victoria Peak,
Stanley Beach,financial district and Kowloon all around HK. It was so cool he would drop us off give us a cell phone and we would call him when we were ready to go and he would pick us up where he dropped us off. When we got back to the hotel our room was ready and when the attendant opened the door all I could say was Wow! The view was perfect 27 floors up in the tower and an unobstructed view of HK Harbor, Breathtaking!
On our Floor 27 and in our suite we were treated like royalty!
But when we got to that zoo they call a lobby it was a different story. Since we were guests at the hotel we didn't have to wait for a table for afternoon tea we were just seated. But after that it was like we were forgotten the service was horrible! Slow, overworked,unhappy,inattentive, and it was like the servers were just going through the motions no smiles or anything. The afternoon tea at the Raffles in Singapore was so much better.
They were so slow I had to just get up and look like I was walking away before they would bring the bill. They brought the bill then I was totally disappointed!
Anyway there are so many shoppes in the hotel a lot of tourists come by the hotel to window shop or browse. So you don't know who is a guest or a tourist so they treat everyone like a tourist .....not Good! At the Raffles in Singapore they did a great job of separating the tourists from the residents. And while doing it made both feel good! The Peninsula could take some lessons from them. My suggestion is that while in the hotel residents have a label pin signifying them as a hotel guest so everyone , security, shoppes on the property, all hotel staff including the afternoon tea staff supply the same level of service experienced in our tower room. Those tower rooms weren't free and the level of service I expected was not delivered to me throughout the hotel.
For example we checked out at 9pm you would expect a hotel like the Peninsula to have a Grand Ball Room for major events. No they had the main lobby completely fixed up for an Arts Gala where all guests checking in or checking out had to tip toe around these privacy curtains and video screens to leave the hotel totally unacceptable. Now the hotel did tell us in writing about the event the night before. But at that point what could you do 10,000 miles away from home.I've stay at the Chicago Peninsula and was so impressed with everything we experienced there during our visit.
The birthday fruit and gifts given to me upon my arrival was a very nice touch and I appreciated the touch.
However, the level of service throughout the hotel during our stay was so inconsistent I was disappointed !"
619,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Out of this world,"Previously I have only used the spa at The Peninsula, however I have now had the pleasure of staying there.

I cannot fault the hotel whatsoever. Everything was perfect. We stayed four nights here and arranged the hotel Rolls Royce transfer to and from the airport. Even for the novelty value this has to be a must if you stay here. On arrival you are collected direct from the airbridge as you disembark the aircraft and are escorted through the terminal to the car, which is very welcome.

On arrival at the hotel we were escorted straight to our room where check in was completed. Our room was a courtyard room which overlooked the hotel entrance and part of the harbour. Even on the fourth floor you couldn't hear any noise whatsoever from outside. I can't even begin to list the features the room has as they are extensive. There are control panels beside the bed and various ones on the walls to control most of the features. Room was excellently furnished and very modern looking.

Breakfast we had in The Verandah which was excellent. Not the biggest selection I have come across in breakfast buffets but certainly one of the highest quality. We also ate in The Lobby several times for dinner. Again the food was amazing. We did want to have afternoon tea in The Lobby (which is supposedly a must in HK!), however when I discovered they only have raisin scones and not plain scones (I dislike raisin scones!) we decided not to have afternoon tea.

The gym, swimming pool and spa were also excellent. The changing rooms have a sauna, steam, hot pool and cold plunge pool. There is also a separate excellent Thermal Suite which is only for guests booking a spa treatment. This is very quiet and has a huge sauna with harbour views, a wonderful steam room and an experience shower which smells amazing!

All the staff without exception were amazing. They were very friendly and would genuinely make you feel welcome and that nothing was too much trouble for them.

The only downside to the stay was when we had to leave! I will certainly be back here in the future."
620,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Classy and fabulous,"We travel a lot and this hotel far exceeded our expectations. While a bit pricey, I promise you it's worth every last penny. The rooms are really high tech and luxurious. The room had an espresso maker, a tea set, and fresh fruit daily. In the lobby they have a five piece band and a piano player and singer in the bar. There are upscale stores in the lobby, the concierge is exceedingly helpful. If you need a ride somewhere they will take you in a Rolls-Royce for that (extra charge).The breakfast buffet is also spectacular. Do not hesitate to book this hotel."
621,Date of stay: March 2017,30,Beautiful and classy,"We just visited the lobby of this hotel, which faces the harbour. It is very impressive. So is the area where tea is served. Always a few Rolls Royce cars in front of the entrance. Stop by to have a look if you are in the neighborhood."
622,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Great location. Very well equipped room,"Located on TST shopping street and food street. Pool with nice harbor view. Fitness club allowed outside members. Great facilities throughout hotel. Rooms were refurbished. High technology stuffs in room with fax and printer, automated make up mirror, tablet to control room light tv ac and etc. thumbs up."
623,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Afternoon Tea,"We were recommended to go for afternoon tea at The Peninsula on Kowloon. We were not disappointed. Tables are allocated on a first come, first served basis on 2pm.
We arrived just after 1:30pm and joined a queue which had formed inside the main foyer. We didn't wait too long before being shown to a table. There was more than enough to eat and although expensive, it was a lovely treat, so glad we took up this recommendation."
624,Date of stay: March 2017,50,High Tea at the Peninsula,"Reward yourself with a marvelous gastronomical experience by enjoying High Tea at the Peninsula Hotel, Hong Kong. The opulent surroundings of the marble lobby with its coffered ceilings and lush carpets may lull you into believing you are a British Duke or Duchess. Sounds from the string quartet waft from the balcony as you munch on small sandwiches & delectable sweets. The Pinnacle tea with its orange zest was a perfect compliment to the treats.
You've done it once. Now move on to other adventures.

Enjoy."
625,Date of stay: February 2017,50,The treat of a lifetime!,"This hotel harks back to ""old Hollywood"". With white glove bellboys at the door, live music from the balcony, fantastic architecture and a beautiful lobby that is both a lobby and restaurant. We had lunch, dinner and tea here. It is simply the best people watching place. The architecture is wonderful. It is a treat just sit in the lobby!

If you are coming from the airport or cruise terminal, be sure to arrange for the hotel car to pick you up. They have a fleet of vintage Rolls Royce's. You are treated like royalty and feel as if you really are! The Rolls are not much more cost than the Mercedes that they offer. Treat yourself - you will not be sorry. My husband and I were celebrating out 35th wedding anniversary. This was a great treat. (We used the service to take us to the airport as well.) We are spoiled forever!

The rooms are beautiful with every hi tech amenity you could think of, At first I thought you needed to have a PHD in computer software or engineering, but actually found each device very intuitive and easy to use.

The room was very large with a wonderfully comfortable bed. The sitting area was spacious and the desk was outfitted with everything you would need to conduct business- a printer, scissors, paperclips, pens, stapler remover just to name a few things. My husband and I both travel with computers and work on our vacations. This was the best equipped room we have every been in. There is also a separate makeup table and lots of closet space.

We are very experienced travelers and have to say that this is the best hotel we have ever visited. The service is superb. The staff seems to know what you want or need before you do. The shopping arcade was excellent. How could it not be when you get off the elevator and there is a Harry Winston store right in front of you!!"
626,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Quality First !,"This is the place to stay. Try to get a room with the view !Start from the airport pick-up with style. Friendly reception.perfect service, fine room just perfect as it has to be.The restaurant has a unique variety of fine food. The buffet is excellent. Again very friendly service. Hight tea in the afternoon is a must. The pool is elegant and has a view.Breakfast was full of different tastes. Asian and European . All in all , just the best !"
627,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Classical !!,This is one of my favorite Hotel just because of its architecture and design. The grand stair case and bell boys in white uniform and white gloves reminds you the old colonial touch. The rooms are nice and spacious considering the modern day room size in Hong Kong . The harbour view rooms are fabulous. The place which i liked most was the Swiss restaurant Chessa. the food and ambiance is amazing. I hope the waiters could have smiled a bit otherwise everything is perfect. Hang On its not over yet - Do not come back without paying a visit to Felix and book a table by the window and witness the magical view
628,Date of stay: March 2017,50,"Perfect visit in Hong Kong, perfect hotel is Peninsula","A blend of the classic, with its founding in 1923, much of the architecture is original and The Peninsula pays homage to its history in many ways to make a guest's stay classic as well.

The rooms have every amenity one could think of and more! Of course the curtains that open automatically to welcome in the morning light and incredible harbor views... spectacular! Evening night views are like a choreographed light show as one looks across The harbor to Hong Kong Island.

The pool's contemporary design opens beautifully out into the Hong Kong skyline.... enjoy either an inner or outer pool, with drinks or meals available. Our teenagers loved the pool on a previous visit and we find it to be a respite on this visit.

The spa has a wide array of treatments, services, relaxation areas, and ways to slow down or find deep escape from stresses.

Service is impeccable! From the welcoming greeting and check-in to each restaurant's serving teams.

We are celebrating our 20th anniversary and enjoying this treasure of Hong Kong that we enjoyed on our honeymoon 20 years ago! We will return again, I am sure."
629,Date of stay: March 2017,40,"Beautiful, perfect 5* luxury and hi tech .... but why 4* food?","We enjoyed a wonderful stay here. Our room was at the main wing with view to the harbour. The room layout and decor are really up to our taste, and we found it surprisingly quiet too.
The hi tech lovers can really have fun with all the different remote functions, which work to perfection.
The pool area is really beautiful spot to spend a moment, even it it is just to relax a bit with a drink or snack. The steam room and gym are well managed too.

So the only disappointment was really the breakfast and a la carte food. The coffee order appeared to have been forgotten, and when it finally arrived, we were surprised to find that this was nothing to write home about. Maybe the F&B manager should give this a serious thought. Why not visit Cupping Room for a coffee tasting, and then add one of these exquisite coffee options to the menu. The real coffee lovers will rave over it.
We had ordered oatmeal, which arrived almost cold, and the same with the fried eggs. We loved the blueberries, but missed the ever popular Papaya, which is certainly more nutritious than melon.

We will come back again to this wonderful hotel, but please - and we will appreciate it so much - do ensure to bring the F&B standard up to par with the five stars."
630,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Perfection at it's Best,"We had the privilege of staying here for 3 nights as part of a prize. This is so top class and luxurious. The staff are so professional yet accommodating and friendly. Everything about this hotel was perfect, the service, the breakfast, the pool, the spa, the room - so wish we could stay here on our return to HK next month. The perfect hotel in the perfect location."
631,Date of stay: March 2017,50,"Great food, nice staff","On March 8, my two friends and I visited The Verandah buffet at the Peninsula Hong Kong to celebrate one of my friends’ birthday who is allergic to nuts.

Overall the service is flawless as a full-service hotel, the staff displays a sense of courtesy and politeness. The location is convenient which is beside one of the exits of the underground station. There are various of food choices including: Vegetarian salads, seafood, mains, and the desserts. Since it is a buffet restaurant, whether or not the servers are able to collect the dishes on time is crucial, it is delightful to say the restaurant maintained a high training standard. As for one of my friends who is allergic to tree nuts, the professional duty manager has demonstrated for her the courses which she can consume and even asked the chef to make a special dish for her upon our request.

Some of the flaws we have discovered are quite acceptable. During our dining experience, we have discovered that some of the salmon are displayed in large amount, which could not be renewed from time to time. It induces that some of the salmon is not fresh. Even though the staff are professional, we found the services provided are quite static and lack of a sense of personal touch. Furthermore, all of the food labels are all in English, which could be a big concern for the Chinese people who are lacking of bilingual skills. On the other side, we believe that the nostalgia might be one of the main features of The Verandah restaurant.

Overall, the experience is great and the food are delicious which is definitely the reason why it is popular among the local Hong Kong people."
632,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Beautiful hotel,What a great hotel. Truly first class from the check in to the valet service. Typical rainy season in Hong Kong but we were well taken care of. Come enjoy and be pampered. View is from our room again sorry about the rain.
633,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Grand Luxury,"This is our fifth hotel on our mission to replicate the early nineteenth century ""Grand Tour"", visiting the dozen or so 100-year-plus grand hotels in South East Asia still in operation from the late 1800's and early 1900's. The Peninsular certainly earns its reputation for luxury and grandeur, with beautiful and stately architecture and the best of everything, from the restaurants and bars to the gym and spa.

Having lived in Hong Kong for a few years in the early 1990s, I first encountered the peninsular ""pre-upgrade"" (the addition of the new multi-story tower section) and dinned a few times in the various restaurants, but this is the first time I have stayed in the hotel.

The rooms still have the classic Asian-influenced luxurious design, but they also subtly include the most modern technology appointments I have experienced in a hotel room. All beautifully done.

Overall, I loved the chance to stay at the hotel. The only down side is the price. It is the most expensive of the remaining ""Grand Hotels"", and when compared with peers such as the Sofitel Metropole in Hanoi, the Mandarin Oriental in Bang Kok and the Raffles in Singapore, it is certainly on the expensive side. I think you can get similar luxury, but without some of the history and prime views, in other prestige hotels in Hong Kong for less cost. And of the hotels I have visited thus far on the Grand Tour, my favorite is still the Mandarin Oriental, but if you are in Hong Kong and cost is not a barrier, the Peninsular offers modern luxury and five-star service in one of the most iconic locations in Hong Kong."
634,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Perfect for quiet romantic get away.,"Actually stayed here for Valentines day with my wife. The rooms are amazing, the old windows and exterior of the hotel have been maintained as there is a gap between the old outer shell and the remodeled rooms. Speaking of which, the rooms are very quiet, spacious and clean. Again, another hotel room larger than my apartment in Hong Kong.

The breakfast is great. However, the hotel is popular for afternoon tea among tourists, so don't expect to have lunch/tea in the hotel area as there is a long wait which is kind of annoying. With that exception, the hotel is very luxurious, quiet, great service, and near lots of shopping on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong."
635,Date of stay: March 2017,50,thank you péninsula,"The Best picture in real time you CAN see in hk!!! Here the days and night are like a Dream thank you péninsula part of my business meeting in hk .

I stay here for business and my meeting are super moments . Life in this hotel is gold 24/24
I love you peninsula"
636,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Excellent,"The HK Peninsula is he best. The room is very spacious with everything anyone needs, the staff are ultra friendly when I asked them to help and the afternoon tea is just so delicious because of the perfect balance of sweet and salty."
637,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Best hotel I've ever stayed in,"I don't even know where to start. Everything is as it should be. Excellent service the whole time we stayed there. We got a free upgrade with our room so we had a harbor view. The food and service is excellent and I have to admit that I took home a lot some souvenirs. The soapbox is a nice touch and my creditcard didnt like the souvenir (chocolate) store downstairs. We arrived with backpacks but we didnt feel unwelcome at all. Everybody was so friendly and welcoming that you never want to leave. Book it with breakfast, that is something you don't want to miss.
Like I said: Best hotel I've ever stayed in. So yes it is expensive but it is worth every penny.
This hotel was on my bucketlist and I don't think it will ever leave my bucketlist because I want to come back! .

1 sidenote: I asked some questions on FB before my stay and I received a response after my stay. So the Social Media Manager doesn't give the same service as the hotel. But this was the only complain I can think of."
638,Date of stay: March 2017,50,World Class,"Must bring a swim suit to enjoy HK's best indoor pool. The afternoon high tea was exquisite. By far the best hotel experience for me, beyond 6 star. Try the food in their Chinese Restaurant, very delicate and fine."
639,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Worth the splurge to stay in this iconic hotel,"This is one of the most expensive hotels in Hong Kong, but it is worth it to experience the iconic Peninsula Hotel. The service is outstanding; the rooms are beautifully decorated and if there are two of you traveling the bathrooms have the ideal set up for two people. It is also a historic hotel that has been modernized but with the feel of the history before. The breakfast buffet is decadent and you don't have to eat anything all day after indulging in the extensive variety of food available. The pool on the 8th floor is gorgeous with sweeping views over the Hong Kong skyline and harbor."
640,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Amazing experience!,"This hotel has amazing rooms with every amenity you could need. The staff is terrific, and all of the restaurants that we tried were wonderful. It's expensive, but worth the experience! Be sure to try the breakfast buffet on the 2nd floor...it is really great!"
641,Date of stay: January 2017,40,DINNER AT THE PEN,"The Felix restaurant sits on the 28th floor of this magnificent 'Old Money' hotel.
It is wildly expensive yet both the food and service counter this. The decor is fairly stunning and the cocktail bar a must visit. A bottle of Cloudy Bay Chardonnay though was very over priced. The food is Hotel European, beautifully arranged on the plater, well cooked but not really exceptional."
642,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Overnight,My husband and I are overnighting at The Peninsula after two weeks in Vietnam and Cambodia and it is incredible. Our room -2512- has a harbor view directly across from the nightly laser show. We enjoyed the afternoon High Tea - cocktails at Felix- and dinner at Spring Moon. Delicious Chinese restaurant.
643,Date of stay: September 2016,50,A must see and a must try in Hong Kong,"The hotel is one of the most iconic pieces of architecture in Hong Kong and provides a link to Hong Kong's opulent past. The building is full of character and charm unlike many of Hong Kong's modern and bland high rise glass facaded office blocks. The lobby lounge is spectacular to see and is always crowded with diners, business people and tourists.

When afternoon high-tea is served in the lounge an ensemble plays on a balcony on the mezzanine floor and overlooking the guests. High-tea is very popular and be prepared to wait in a queue for a table to become free. If you are short on time, come back in the late afternoon when high tea is finished and it may be quicker to get a table and have a drink or a cup of tea and cake.

The service is exemplary and what you would expect from a five star hotel and staff go out of their way to pander to your every whim. The restaurants and bars on the upper floors and I particularly like The Verandah with its relaxed and quiet environment which is quite different from the busy and boisterous lobby lounge and The Bar where one can relax over a quiet drink or engage in a commercial discussion with your business partners."
644,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Stylish,"Very elegant and luxurious but not over the top. Stylish, in good taste. Very good service, friendly staff.
Amazing view over the peninsula. Good space for events and entertainment - I've been in a function room with a beautiful terrace.
Nice breakfast, good food in restaurants. The lobby seems to be a very popular place for afternoon tea- every day there was at least 10 people queuing up to get a table."
645,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Afternoon Tea at the Peninsula,"Walking into Hong Kong's Peninsula is like walking into the hotel lobby of a Hemingway novel set in the 1920's. I had afternoon tea here with a friend and we enjoyed delicious teas and finger sandwiches, all with white glove service."
646,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Fabulous,"We stayed one night at The Peninsula but I could have stayed forever!
We treated ourselves to the Rolls Royce transfer which was well worth it as we were whisked from the door of the plane to the car in no time. We booked one of the cheapest rooms which was plenty big enough and gave us everything we needed for a short stay. The pool and massages in the spa were a great way to overcome our jet lag, we both had a scrub and a massage and felt very relaxed afterwards. We ate at the Felix restaurant with stunning views over the harbour, the food
on the menu didn't sound too exciting however when it arrived it far exceeded our expectations. We really could not fault the service, there seemed to be someone on hand to help us whenever we needed them.
Definitely one of the best hotels we have stayed in."
647,Date of stay: March 2017,50,Relaxing,Stayed for 3 nights and enjoyed very much. It is expensive but worth it with beautifully fitted out rooms dedicated steward for room. Fresh fruit daily. At check in they made you feel special. Wonderful breakfasts. Wide selection of foods from Asian to Western.
648,Date of stay: February 2017,50,The Best!,"Stayed in this historical grand hotel for 4 days and was wowed, The suite was extremely spacious and modern. My wife and I think it was literally the best suite we have stayed in -- ever. The breakfast buffet was lacking nothing and we even discovered a few tasty new items. Wait staff was superb in their duties and were friendly and polite. Enjoyed having drinks in The Bar with the more than ever helpful bartenders. I need to say a young woman bartender was beyond congenital and helpful. Wish I could remember her name it was something like Shinzee (sorry about the spelling) but she worked very hard getting us recommendations and information. Thanks for everything Shinzee. We also enjoyed afternoon tea in a picturesque lobby. Very relaxing. The hotel's location is great and nothing seemed too far away. I'm unsure how another hotel could top this place for service and quality. If asked I would say stay here as you will enjoy these accommodations.. ."
649,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Best hotel in HK!,"Celebrated my son's birthday there a few years ago. Best hotel, best location! Right in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui. Great service, and newly renovated rooms. Great experience overall. Food was good, too."
650,Date of stay: March 2017,50,This tops them all,"We have stayed at fine hotels all around the world and I can honestly say that this is the finest anywhere, anytime. The location is excellent, facilities are superb and staff is great. The rooms and public spaces are very well designed and extremely well finished and maintained. Your every care is anticipated and resolved in advance.

My advice: When making your reservation go ahead and spring for $200 +/- extra for the airport concierge service. They whisk you out of the airport and into one of the specially fitted Rolls Royce limousines for the too short trip to the hotel. It is the best money I've ever spent."
651,Date of stay: November 2016,50,A great historic hotel,"The Peninsula is one of the oldest hotels in Hong Kong, and it has managed to keep its original features intact. I have been to a number of swimming pools in Hong Kong and this one has the best views. You see the central island skyline, which is a must see as the lights come on. The rooms have all been recently refurbished and are therefore finished to a high standard."
652,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Breakfast buffet,Breakfast buffet so much variety i enjoyed the omelete you can pick what filling and they will make so nice to enjoy this with my friendjust walking around in this luxury 5 star hotel is amazing did not stay here but i bet would be expensive.
653,Date of stay: February 2017,40,"Fantastic historic hotel, overpriced with slow staff.","The Hotell Peninsula I had the pleasure to stay at 30 years ago. Now was the time again since my wife was with me this time. I have visited HKG more then 70 times since first time in business. 30 years ago it was fantastic to be picked up with an Rols at the airport with alert staff that felt you feeling important as an guest. This time I must say it is more of a historic event feeling. Nice driver, but at hotel do not expect to be treated any special, you are just a visitor. You have to wait in line when groups arrive, you have to wait for room half a day, no extra given as an morning breakfast. All is overpriced and I would say there are much more enjoyment for the money at other hotels. This has become an historic museum and staying there feels the same. No specials for an hotelguest. We changed to another hotel after two nights, same price but what a different world!!"
654,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Legendary 6 star hotel,"As one of the oldest hotel in HK, the building itself is already a valuable heritage that cannot miss. But what make it continue to be the best, a good standard in service is prominent. I can feel all the staff are professionally trained. The room is spacious and fully facilitates with high tech LED touch screen panel, multi charger, nespresso coffee machine and wide range of stationery. The restaurants are all above standard. The management is making big effort to provide the best to the guest. Please keep up the good work and continue the legend."
655,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Just speachless,"I have visited several times HK and this is my first time in Peninsula hotel, the service is great, location is unique, the lobby is glamorous, the rooms has luxury design , design and details preserve in this property"
656,Date of stay: February 2017,50,One of the Best Hotels in the World,"The Peninsula in Hong Kong is one of the Best Hotels in the World .. it is beyond a doubt the best service . The Lobby is the same as it was in 1928 when it was built , a grand space where people have high tea everyday .
the Rooms are amazing , with every detail thought through , including a manicure dryer in the dressing room .
A must is reserving a harbor view room , to watch all of the life on the Hong Kong side and the Harbor . A wonderful Hotel .."
657,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Great visit in November,"Stayed for three nights in November. Took the Rolls Royce pick up from the airport, which was a fun experience. Overall, we had a wonderful stay at the Peninsula flagship. The staff is excellent and the room is well-appointed to meet all of your needs (i.e., from blackout blinds to convenient charging plugs to even a nail dryer) while traveling. Additionally, brunch in the hotel is excellent. Very short walk to the very to get across the harbour. Highly recommend to all."
658,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Beautiful Stay,"Continued our anniversary trip from The Peninsula Shanghai to the The Peninsula Hong Kong. Check in was excellent with the signature RR from the airport. Had a slight issue with the first suite they gave us (in the older tower of the hotel and a low floor...view was right into construction site of intercontinental across the street ) we let management know and soon enough we were upgraded to the new tower suites. Our suite was just perfect. I had the magical Hong Kong view I dreamed about. The living room was set daily with fresh fruit, magnificent floral arrangements, and newspapers. The greatest aspect of the Peninsula Hotels is the great care they give to each detail in the room. From in room nail dryers, to amazing bathroom amenities (bath salts and aromatic oils and floral arrangements replenished around the bathtub daily---heaven!) The entire room is controlled electronically by multiple iPads throughout the rooms. Really not one detail missed! They gave us Evian water bottles whenever we needed and even placed a special bookmark in my book when I was out for my daily excursions. The indoor/outdoor pool is superb and I recommend sitting out on the sun deck after a leisurely breakfast. The hotel is just wow. The shopping arcade is like no other. My husband ordered custom made shirts from a shop in the arcade and they came to our room the next day to do the fitting...I mean you can't get better service than that. The breakfast buffet was beautiful, plentiful and delicious. Service was excellent. Concierge was extremely helpful. The hotel bars and lounges are excellent. Overall, we had an amazing unbelievable stay and will hopefully be back to The Peninsula Hong Kong again."
659,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Pure CLASS!,"6-star experience from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. Have stayed in a few great hotels in the world, but this definitely takes the cake. Rolls-Royce transfer from airport(met airside by hotel rep). In room check-in. Champagne and chocolates waiting in room. Great location on Kowloon side. Caught the 'Symphony of Light' whilst enjoying a lovely cocktail at Fenix bar. Great Whisky selection in the downstairs bar. Bed was one of the best I've ever slept on. Didn't get a chance to eat at one of their restaurants, but the breakfast buffet was great. All the usual suspects of a 5-star breakfast buffet, but the local dishes were all of superior quality, especially the dumplings."
660,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Stunning location for tea,"We visited the Peninsula for afternoon tea. After waiting in line for some 20 minutes we were seated. We ordered tea, coffee and the selection of sandwiches and pastries. All was timely delivered by the friendly and well dressed staff. The food itself was delicious.

The interior of the Peninsula is absolutely stunning and definitely worth a visit!"
661,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Superb hotel!!,"Arguably one of the best hotels we have ever stopped in - and we've been to a few superb hotels worldwide. A degree of refined elegance from an earlier era, but with the very latest mod-cons - our room was 'controlled' by one of three ipads in the room (TV, lights, curtains, heating), TV and radio in the his and hers bathroom, a coffee machine and even a nail dryer - yes nail!! - and we had a basic room! We had complimentary champagne, cake and fruit in the room for my wife's birthday. Room cleaning and turn down service was highly efficient. We watched the fireworks over Victoria Harbour, on the hotel flat roof area, for the Chinese New Year during which the hotel served complimentary 'fizz' - truly memorable. Breakfast was one of the most extensive we have come across in terms of variety catering for every taste / nationality with high class service from staff in suits - every time you got up your napkin was refolded. We only ate at night once in the hotel, in a small bar on the first floor. The 'posh' beef burger and chicken nuggets were really nice, but with a glass of wine and a beer this came to £70 - I guess you pay the price in such hotels.

That said, the hotel is excellently located close to the Star Ferry port and the Big Red Bus stops just outside the back door with a ticket sales person nearly always there. We bought 48 hour tickets for the Big Red Bus and found that a great service, saw all the main sights, great commentary and useful free and speedy entrance onto the Tram to the summit of HK Island, a free harbour cruise and a 30 minute sampan ride - worth the effort. Concierge recommended a Chinese Dum Sim restaurant in the Cultural Centre close to the hotel called Serenade. We were the only 'apparently English' in the restaurant, but as usual, if you go where the locals go you get a fab meal - and we did!!

All in all a great hotel - some have said 'tired' but we didn't think so - we saw the queues for the renowned afternoon tea, but didn't partake.

An expensive, but a real treat."
662,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Absolutely first class,"From the Rolls Royce airport transfer in to the Rolls Royce back to the airport our two night stay at The Peninsula has been first class. We've stayed at many of the world's best hotels and this hotel outranks them on nearly every detail.

Whisked straight from the Rolls to our room (checkin formalities completed in our room by the lovely young hostess who showed us all the features of the room and couldn't be more helpful).

The room itself was on the small side for a six star hotel suite but not the smallest we've had by any means and behind almost all the beautiful glossy lacquer walls were clever drawers and storage for everything we might need. My wife loved the makeup table with lighted mirror, hair dryer and nail dryer. I loved how I could control every feature of the room and even order room service easily from the tablets on either bedside table.

The room was quiet, the bed very comfortable and the room service impeccable.

The spa is *incredible* Worth it for the unique and amazing 'experience' showers, crystal steam room and dry sauna with a floor to ceiling panoramic view of the busy Hong Kong island skyline and shipping lane. The pool and gym are also very well equipped and spotless.

Definitely coming back here. If budget is no object you will find the Peninsula will anticipate your needs and fulfil them expertly, efficiently and speedily."
663,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Birthday festival of Me!,"A quick trip to celebrate a birthday, wherelse but the Pen. Wow, loved it from top to toe. A highlight was the thermal pools and facilities in the pool area. I was alone, and thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful cold n hot pools, saunas. The quality and serenity were divine. Our room was on the 6th floor and my time at day spa was well spent with a customized facial and use of all the facilities there. A divine crystal sat in the middle of the steam room and again I had it all to myself. High tea, dinner at Felix, a yoga mat with a view. Loved it!!"
664,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Amazing,"As the saying goes....u get what you pay for! The room is beautiful! Bathroom is amazing! The pool is really special....I'm even going to go for a swim right before I check out! The staff couldn't have been more helpful! Thank you, Hazel T. You added a touch of warmth to our stay!"
665,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Elegance at it's Best,"After the long trip from the States to Hong Kong, it was a delight to be met at the airport by the professional liaison from the Peninsula. They were there as we got off the plane, escorted us through baggage and customs and straight to the waiting Rolls. It was fast, it was painless and it was definitely worth the price to start our trip this way.

The hotel is elegant, calm and well-placed geographically in Kowloon; close to the Star Ferry (to Hong Kong Island) and the port we needed (Ocean Terminal). There is lots of shopping in the area. Staff was pleasant and accommodating, even allowing us to extend our check-out time, so we could take a break before boarding our ship.

Our room was beautiful with a wonderful view of the harbour. Every amenity you could think of was in the room. I don't think I've ever seen a nail dryer in a hotel room - in fact, I know I have not!

We were not ready for any large meals and enjoyed a light dinner in the lobby restaurant while listening to some nice live music. There are plenty of other dining options.

I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
666,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Worth the experience,"Everything is good as expected during my stay from 13-17 Feb. A classic hotel in Hong Kong where service standard is above average. The hotel is adequately staff with a grand lobby that reflects its star level.
I stayed on level 23 and the room I am in is impressive with technology leading the pack as one of the many compliments.
Bed sheets is of good quality but i do not like the pillows as it is too hollow. The mattress is a bit of the hard side but it depends on each person likings. The best bed is still the W Hotel one.

Overall, its worth the try."
667,Date of stay: February 2017,50,The Grand Dame endures,"The Peninsula, the Grand Dame of Hong Kong hotels, never fails to please and thus, it has endured. The Peninsula treatment starts when one gets off the plane at the Hong Kong International Airport and is escorted by a member of the Peninsula ground staff. After the baggage is secured and loaded on the awaiting Rolls Royce one is refreshed with a chilled drink and a cold towelette as you are quietly whisked away on a pleasant forty minute drive to the hotel. Checking- in is a breeze as hotel staff smile and warmly welcome you home by name. One will find said staff extremely friendly and ready to please. Get a room fronting Hong Kong harbor and enjoy expansive unparalleled views amidst tastefully high tech and plush surroundings. Catch some rays as you sip a cocktail at the 7th floor sun-deck then go for a swim at the gorgeous temperature controlled 8th floor pool. The Verandah at the first floor serves the most excellent buffets and should not be missed. This hotel has set the bar for a high standard of service in the industry and has maintained the same through the years. May she endure as the Grand Dame for many more years to come."
668,Date of stay: February 2017,50,exquisite,"I've never been to a Peninsula hotel that wasn't astonishing. 5 stars across the board on this place. Even if you aren't staying here, go to the Felix for a cocktail or dinner and fantastic views across the water of HK island. This place is perfect."
669,Date of stay: September 2016,50,On point in every way.,"From the moment we walked off the plane, we were greeted by representatives from the hotel and transported in a luxurious Rolls Royce to the upscale property.
Breakfast is NOT to be missed as is High Tea.
The staff were simply amazing and knowledgeable in every aspect."
670,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Peninsula opulence,"When they said the Rolls Royce transfer began at the 'air bridge' we never expected the guy to pick us up as we entered the terminal but he did! He took us in one if those electric buggies through to Passport Control sweeping the 'hoi poloi' aside in an hysterical manner. Embarrassing really, but great on the iPhone video.
The trip in the RR was smooth as silk and we had a fantastic reception at the hotel and an upgrade room, though this is not guaranteed if they are full. The hotel is ridiculously expensive with a buffet dinner at $200 but life is not a practice so do this and remember it forever and when friends tell you of their holiday in Spain you will think,yes well........did they queue up to have tea at your hotel and join the hordes who were out there at all hours of the day and night taking photos of your hotel? This is a hotel to remember."
671,Date of stay: February 2017,50,Reward yourself.,I made he mistake of going with a budget hotel because I was going to arrive late at night. Staying with this hotel has dramatically improved my impression of Hong Kong. You're not making a mistake with staying at this property.
672,Date of stay: January 2017,40,High Tea at the Peninsula -- Sweet Treat!,"I was told to go by a work associate and I was happy I did. The hotel itself is gorgeous. The tea is offered in the huge foyer with dozens of tables, although expect to wait as it is first come, first served. We only stood in line for 30 minutes. My friend and I had a lovely table with good views of the front door for people watching. The tables are spaced nicely so not on top of the next person. Complete with white linens. At first the waiter seemed to be rushing us as he came over 3 times in 5 minutes asking us what we wanted. I inwardly groaned thinking we would be rushed, but gratefully, once he took the order, no one hurried us. We were not hungry so simply ordered the tea with scones. Scones yummy. Wished they offered to refill the tea pot with hot water. Had to flag him down for that. Overall, such a ""ladies"" day thing to do -- don't miss it -- it's fun!
Note: I didn't stay at the hotel, so can't comment on that."
673,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Clementine the concierge*****,What a beautiful hotel!! We really enjoyed our visit and particularly appreciated the help of the concierge Clementine!! She went above and beyond to make sure our short visit to Hong Kong was a memorable one! She really knows Hong Kong and sent us to some great restaurants for dinner and brunch and she ensured we made it to the must see Dragon's Back!! #SuspiciousCat
674,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Very pampering!,The amenities in t he hotel rooms are like I've never seen before. Electronics every where. There were at least 3 iPads to control everything! Very comfortable to say the least. Great service throughout the hotel! And a Rolls Royce to/from the airport!!
675,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Simply WOW,"This hotel is probably one of the best hotel i've stayed in. Everything was perfect. The staff, the decoration, the rooms, the service, the food. I mean everything. Also the pool has an amazing view. It is in TSIM TSH TSUI. which is in the central of hongkong."
676,Date of stay: February 2017,50,One of The BEST Romantic & LUXURY Hotels on EARTH,"The Peninsula Hong Kong was an absolute treat for us on our last days in Hong Kong . The Peninsula Hotel brand amazed us on their exceptional services during our stay first until end . Flawless and Perfection.

677,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Tradition,"The hotel is of course very nice, however, being so touristic, the hall is a bit too crowed especially for the afternoon tea. It doesn't feel very exclusive. Our room was very comfortable but a bit small for hong kong standards. Yet it gets excellent because the staff was really amazing. The french guy at the reception (unfortunately I can't remember his name) was outstanding, giving us the best advices and helping us getting a table in a restaurant that was fully booked. Thank you again!"
678,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Perfect,Perfect hotel. The best in town. Good restaurants. Friendly staff. At the very center of the town. It is expensive but deserves the price. There is a nice new year party at the front of the hotel every year.
679,Date of stay: January 2017,50,"Fantastic, Surprises Everywhere!","This hotel was amazing, with great service and rooms with the greatest technology!!!!! There are buttons to open mirrors, curtains and blinds, power boxes and more!!!The shower has about 5 settings, and there is a thing in the bath!!!! The pool is incredible with an amazing view, and the spa area is beautiful!!! Great just to relax, and very comfortable!!!!"
680,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Recent Stay at Peninsula Hotel,"We stayed in a Superior Harbour View suite on the fifth floor. The room was superb and was very well appointed.
We were there for 4 days and made good use of the Hotels facilities such as the pool and spa areas. My husband and i both had massages which were excellent . The spa facilities were amazing.
We had our youngest child (11 ) with us and she was made to feel very welcome .I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to all our friends ."
681,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Simply the best,"This hotel has everything. Staff are pleasant and efficient, anticipating guests' every need. Our room on the 22nd floor was fabulous - hi-tech, well equipped and very. spacious. The bathroom was equally spacious, luxurious and modern.

Standards throughout this immaculate hotel are consistently high with a tireless attention to detail. We dined in the rooftop restaurant and the food was superb. Breakfast? With its range of European and Asian dishes did not disappoint either. The spa facilities are wonderful. Cannot think of one thing that would have made our stay more enjoyable."
682,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Felix has a must see view,A colleague of mine recommended this hotel bar for a drink and it was worth the price. Phenomenal view. Once in a lifetime experience. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Drink was good but view unbelievable.
683,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Stunning hotel,"We wanted a luxury finale to our holiday in Thailand so came home via Hong Kong to stay at the world renowned 'Peninsula Hotel'.
We had a Rolls Royce pick us up from the airport which was unforgettable.
We checked in with ease and were then taken to our upgraded room with a view of Kowloon which was breathtaking.

The room had every need taken care of and the attention to detail regarding amenities was fantastic.
The only things we thought odd were that the beds seemed quite hard and the pillows quite flat. We assumed this was normal in Chinese hotels but we found we didn't have the most comfortable of nights sleep.
There was also a smell of sewage coming from the drain in the toilet which we tried to ignore.

Restaurants:
Felix
Food was ok but potatoes were undercooked, steak was medium rare but i asked for medium well. In general not the best we've had.
Views of Hong Kong were stunning but why have wooden blinds hanging everywhere? These should be rolled up in the evening to showcase the full impact of the view.
Manager was very attentive and asked for feedback after every course but we didn't want cause a fuss as this was supposed to be a special evening for us.

Spring Moon
Understated venue with no windows but the amazing food and the manager, Derack Ip made up for this in abundance.
Derack was by far the best host and customer service professional i have ever met. He went above and beyond in showcasing the very best his restaurant had to offer.
He explained all the dishes to us and gave us a demonstration/taster of his favourite teas. He truly made our experience unforgettable. Thank you so much.

The Bar
Great personalised service! The bar tender remembered all our drinks and served us a beautifully presented but huge amount of bar food as the kitchens closed at 1430 so we had no choice but to eat in the bar.
Great venue, impeccable service.

The Veranda
We wouldn't know as we never managed to eat here, always 30 minutes or longer wait for a table. I really wanted breakfast here during our stay but it seemed they were always full. I noticed this had a lot of people who were not hotel guests, i think hotel guests should take priority in this case!

The lobby
Very attentive, professional staff in stunning surroundings.
Always a table available for breakfast so this is where we ended up.
This again feels like a tourist trap at certain times of the day and again hotel guests should take priority in this case. Avoid Saturday night here as everyone in Hong kong comes for evening tea. A victim of its own success i'm sorry to say.

The Spa
Amazing spa, a must for any visitor.
Impeccable service and product offering.
We had muscle tension massage which was very relaxing.
Only problem was that the pool was closed for annual maintainance!! One of the main reasons we booked this hotel as the pool looks stunning! We were never advised of this when booking but i think its between 9th and 19th January so avoid this period if you want to experience the pool.

I imagined someone would ask us how our stay was going as they would have gathered this feedback at the time.
I think they could learn a thing or two from Claridges on how to offer a personal service rather than offering a generic service format."
684,Date of stay: August 2016,40,A landmark hotel in Hong Kong,For those who like to stay in legendary landmark hotels around the world - you have to stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong at least once. Unfortunately I was on my way to Seoul and make a stop over to Hong Kong in the middle of August. I forgot how HOT and HUMID Hong Kong is during August. Never go there in the summer. It's crazy HOT! But the hotel was a heaven from the scorching heat. We used the pool to cool off after a day out in the heat and the service at the sauna and pool area was excellent. The Chinese restaurant there is one of the best in Hong Kong and we really enjoyed the dim-sum there. Frankly - there are much better 5 star hotels in Hong Kong and around the world with better service and hardware but you have to come here at least once and check it off your bucket list and enjoy high-tea at the lobby restaurant like all of the tourist do when they come to Hong Kong -:).
685,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Treated like a Queen,"We have spent four fantastic and unforgettable days at this excellent location. The room was very modern, nice, clean and quiet with a great view. Food in the Japanese Restaurant was great as well as the breakfast. Package Heliflight and Tea Time highly recommended. And we enjoyed a lot the Rolls Royce transfers. The service was outstanding. We felt like being at home. The hotel is also very well located. There is only a 5-10 minutes walk to the ferry going to Hong Kong Island. We recommend also the Big Bus Tours. We had time to do one. So you see in a short time a lot and you get an overview of the city."
686,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Always unforgettable experience,"The hotel lobby is a must go area. In house guest can have priority to make a reservation on Lobby high tea.( you can always see a very long queue lining up for high tea ).

Gaddis,fine dining French restaurant, made fantastic French dishes.The environment is classic! It is hard to find a place like this in HK ( check Dress code ).If you want to propose, Gaddis is your No.1 choice.They said it's 0% failure :> :> :>

Felix, high on 28/F, has a breathtaking view of the Victoria harbour.The food taste fantastically yummy and inspirational!

Spring Moon, their Deep fried Crispy chicken is a must eat dish and it's my kids No. 1 favourite dish here.Besides, they have a Tea master here.If you order their special tea during dinner, theTea master will push his Tea trolley table to your place and made tea in front of you. He will also tell you stories of the tea and bring you to a special tea journey! It's really interesting!

Chesa's cheese fondue is the best in town!The crispy cheese they made after you almost finish your cheese fondue is mouth watering! You can't help to stop eating it! The cozy wooden room brings you to Switzerland and they serve very good Swiss whit wine that is very difficult to find in HK.

For breakfast, if it's included in the room rate, go for Verandah on the 1/F.It is a buffet breakfast but everything is freshly made. The staffs here are very friendly!

The hotel also provide helicopter service.It will be a very good experience to see HK up on a 15-30 minutes fly!

On top of the above, they have a chocolatier in the hotel. All their chocolate are freshly handmade.Dark chocolate is always my favourite. The Chocolate Art piece is amazing and won a lot of international prizes!

As a whole, it is always a wonderful and unforgettable experience to stay in The Peninsula HK!"
687,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Money Well Spent,"Booked directly for a 2 night stay as a wedding anniversary surprise for my wife. Started by getting the Rolls Royce transfer which everyone who visits this property should experience at least once. The opulence of being fetched at the airbridge, brought to immigration, had luggage collected at the belt and brought to the limousine lounge where the patent green RR Phantom was waiting is the most opulent way to begin a holiday in Hong Kong. We were then met at the driveway and checked directly to our room by the wonderful staff. I initially reserved a courtyard room, but we got upgraded to a higher city view room. While the view was not as spectacular as the harbour view one, it was nice enough. There is a separate area in the grand lobby for afternoon tea and it was quite an experience, which guests of the hotel should not pass up.

This being an anniversary celebration, I also splashed out by booking spa treatments in the luxurious couple's suite with a hot tub, steam and a magnificent view of Victoria Harbour. Fresh fruits, drinks and a relaxing atmosphere is certainly THE way to cap a day. Breakfast at the Verandah likewise had an impressive spread of eastern and western options.

The room was opulent but very modern at the same time with tablet controls for just about everything, free movies and daily fruit replenished. A bonus was a surprise bottle of champagne and sweets compliments of the hotel to celebrate our special day.

Spent quite a bit, but worth every dollar.

Return Rolls Royce transfer to the hotel is an excellent cap to a memorable getaway. This was our first time to experience Asia's Grand Dame and it certainly will not be the last."
688,Date of stay: January 2017,40,Building impressive but what you get is less impressive,"Whilst one cannot detract from the grandeur of the building which is steeped in history , the experience itself was a little disappointing. We simply wanted a drink and the only really offer open to us was either afternoon tea served in the lobby or the bar. Afternoon tea had around a 1 hour wait which we were not prepared to do. The bar is up on the first floor, fairly small and out of the way. It has mahogany clad walls which means that it is very dark but on the plus side our trip coincided with happy hour which meant we got 25% off beer (65 HKD per bottle.) A live pianist began playing at around 1830 which did add to the ambience but the dark walls and lack of light meant that it felt a little dreary. I could not fault the staff who were very helpful. Glad I have been but expected more from the experience."
689,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Classic luxury,"We stayed for a total of 5 nights. Reception were excellent, rooms first class, and the staff were very receptive to any problems which were rapidly corrected. On our second one night stay there was a problem with the lighting(it wouldn't turn off). Despite it being late, a technician arrived promptly and sorted it. We used the bars, restaurant, and afternoon tea all of which was first class."
690,Date of stay: January 2017,50,NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD,"I stayed in this hotel many times and also in the most famous hotels around the world.
Definitely, the Peninsula hotel offers an outstanding services from your arrival to your departure. Great reception with well trained staffs, beautiful room with a superb decoration, gorgeous swimming pool, jaccusi and sauna. The breakfast is excellent and the SPA is the finest in the world. This is why, the Peninsula hotel can be classified as the number one in the world. Bravo and congratulations to the management."
691,Date of stay: January 2017,40,"High tea is a must try, expensive but beautiful ambient experience","The decor of the hotel is ridiculously luxe and stunning. High tea begins from 2pm and there's always a long line from 1:30pm. There's classical music playing in the background and food is served in tiers. The food itself is very dainty and aesthetic but mediocrely tasty. It's tastes good but literally tastes like your everyday cucumber sandwich and scone. The spreads are organic though. The setting, the beautiful seats, the chandelier, intricate decor and attentive staff make it worthwhile, it's really beautiful!"
692,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Nobody does it better,"It's always been an ambition of mine to stay here since I watched 'the man with the golden gun' as a small but ambitious child! As our first stop on our world tour, I just had to book the Rolls Royce transfer...what a fantastic service, we were met from the aeroplane and effortlessly transported to the limousine lounge then onwards to the hotel. My partner was speechless! Everything about the hotel was as I had hoped... it was the last few days before Christmas and the hotel was beautifully decorated and lit. There were daily carol services and a great atmosphere.. Our suite was suitably lavish. With the room came 3 hours/day of a chauffeur driven Mini...this was exceptionally cool as we had Phillip drive us to all sorts of interesting places we may not have found ourselves. Overall terrific experience."
693,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Spectacular Stay From Start to Finish!,"I brought my 17-year old son to HK for his first time between Christmas and New Year. Given it was my first time back in 13 years, and not sure when we would visit again, I wanted to make my son's first visit to HK memorable. Thus, we booked a Superior Harbor View Suite. While not cheap, it was worth every penny of it. The views of HK Island and the harbor from our room were spectacular, especially at night during the holiday season! Given we landed at 11pm, we requested a Car Service to transport us to the hotel from airport (we used a Benz service but if you really want to splurge, you can pay up for the Phantom Service).

The car service was well worth it. From the minute we landed, the hotel had someone greet us immediately as we stepped off the jetway and into the gate area, escorting us privately to Customs, and again as soon as we passed Customs, then baggage claim, ultimately to car. Once we arrived at hotel, instead of waiting in line for check in, we were escorted immediately up to our room, where we were checked in privately. After a 23+ hour trip door-to-door, it was so nice to just be able to go directly to your room and not have to deal with lines, etc.

The room itself was spacious (lots of storage and closet space), modern, comfortable, A+ technology. Daily, they would provide and refresh a fresh fruit bowl as needed. And as I stated, definitely splurge for the Harbor View - it is worth every penny. We utilized the gym, pool and various restaurants during our 5 days of stay, and service and quality of food, facilities were all top notch. There's a reason why this hotel has always been one of the best in the world. Having visited this hotel for the afternoon tea in the lobby, but never having stayed before, I had very high expectations, and the Peninsula HK met every single one of them. Location was also extremely convenient - the TST/East TST metro/subway station was out the back door of the hotel - so you can't be any closer.

While I am also a fan of other high end luxury hotels, the location of many of these hotels are on the HK Island side. I guess if you are visiting for business and want to be near Central/business district, I get why you may want to stay on that side of HK. But you would be doing yourself a disfavor - one of the best views in the world is the HK skyline from the harbor, and the only way to see that view is from the Kowloon side. And there's not a better place to be than at the Peninsula HK - there's a reason why this hotel and building has maintained its stellar reputation all these years! Definitely a ""bucket list"" destination for those that enjoy traveling in luxurious style, are hotel snobs and/or just want to create a memorable experience with your loved ones!"
694,Date of stay: December 2016,40,Very impressed with service,"I stayed there before new year for one night.
The hotel is amazing, the location is great.
The Rolls Royce pick up is also great.
The driver ""Tony""is very polite and he drives very good.
No need to mention about the luxury of the car, the best.

Upon arrival, the staffs are waiting for us.
We were escorted to the room for check in.
The staff greeting us ""Nancy"" is very great.
She is really good. She suggested us every information we wanted.

We went for the afternoon tea, and being a guest here , we made early reservation, so no need to wait.

I deduct the star from 5 to 4 because of the internet connection which they have to repair for us and the curtain which cannot be closed. And we have to call the staffs to fix it at midnight.

However, the staffs came to fix it very quickly and it is the mishap of the system of the curtain and the router or modem.

Overall, I really love Peninsula HK. The food here is also tasty.
We are sure to come back again."
695,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Lovely 5-star hotel,"The Peninsula Hotel is located in southern Tsim Sha Tsui where the rooms all face the beautiful Victoria Harbour. Our suite was really large, 169 square meters and features a large living and dining room, a large bedroom and a bathroom with a bathtub facing the kowloon peninsula. It also features a smaller toilet and two entrances for assess. The cleaning service was excellent and staff did their best effort to ensure that customers are satisfied with the hotel, including security services in the lobby area. We were also entitled to the chocolate making factory inside Peninsula Hotel which we understood the process of making delicious and sweet chocolate around. There is a pretty grand lobby which features piano playing by experienced pianest. The swimming pool was good and the lifeguards again ensured everyone's safety all of the time. Overall, an excellent hotel with the best services despite the high prices, it is worth the visit."
696,Date of stay: January 2017,50,World famous landmark,Opulence at its best....from the Rolls Royce (s) in the parking lot painted in the colour of the hotel to the superb history and all the rich and famous that frequented the hotel over the years. Worth a stop off for sure.
697,Date of stay: December 2016,20,"For one of the most expensive hotel, they made it looks cheap. Utterly disappointed.","Wanted to go here for an afternoon tea on our last day of holiday just somewhere chill and enjoyable, I was aware that it is one of the most expensive hotel and it is a landmark too. So I rang ahead and see if I can reserve a table for myself and hubby. They said they do not take booking for afternoon tea and it's first come first serve basis. I was told it will start at 2pm. So we timed it and made out way there just before 2pm.
On entry, there was a lot of people and there is a couple getting their photo shoot as it is their wedding day. That's fair enough. The lobby was very noisy and crowd with no signs to point where everything is, it is like walking into another mall in Hong Kong, which is very disappointed for a 5* hotel.

We found the afternoon tea at last and I can see the Q is already quite long, we decided to see how long the Q actually is, what we thought it maybe a short wait, it turned out it'll be at least 2 hours+ wait from the hotel staff. As well as this, people are Q beside some tables so they can see exactly what they are eating as well, and having a conversation their food as the people sit there and eat at the same time which I found quite a turn off for a 5*

We worked out it'll be at least 4.30 if we are lucky to have this afternoon tea, so we left. What really annoyed us was, what supposed to be relax and luxurious 5* experience afternoon tea, this hotel made it very cheap. It is like all the top brand shop (LV, Celine etc.) outside, if it is popular you must Q. It is liked part of the Hong Kong culture which Hong Kong people really gets it wrong.

If they take bookings and take payments over the phone that will eliminate the disappointments. There is a reason why we all have a phone and you provide a phone number. Personally it will be less stressed on both customers and employees."
698,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Top Class,"We booked the Rolls Royce transfer from the airport which was superb. Fabulous cars and service making for an unforgettable service. On arrival at the Hotel we were met at the reception door and whisked straight to our room for check in. There is little to fault in this Hotel as other reviews suggest. Rooms, level of service and amenities are outstanding. We had difficulty securing a table for four in one of the Hotel restaurants on our first night. The only availability was the buffet, which we were initially disappointed about;however, there are buffets and buffets. This was superb .it managed to provide an intimate dining experience with excellent service, outstanding food all be it with the buffet element. Wonderful experience."
699,Date of stay: January 2017,30,Great place for drinks,"I went there for drinks at the Felix bar. Great and chilled atmosphere and the drinks menu offered a wide selection with nice cocktails and beers. Only downside, and actually a big one, was the view which would have been awesome if it wasn't for the blinds that obstructed most of the view. Sounds like an easy fix though and should definitely be considered by the restaurant."
700,Date of stay: January 2017,50,Tea must not be missed.,Elegant and delightful. Come early as the line can get long. Large selection of teas and delicious food. The scones are perfection. The assistant manager Cora made the experience even more enjoyable. She went out of our way to make sure we were satisfied- thank you for making this a highlight of our trip.
701,Date of stay: November 2016,40,Great view,Really elegant hotel with good service and a great bar at the top of the hotel with some fantastic views and great service. Ask for a view of the bay and the room comes with all you need from chargers to an amazing soap on a special box you can take home as a souvenir
702,Date of stay: October 2016,40,Called in for a drink at this hotel,"We had been out for a large part of the day and decided to stop off at the Peninsula for a drink and to have a look at this amazing hotel. It didn't seem to matter that we were very hot and sweaty - happy to seat us and serve us a drink. Ridiculously priced drinks, but we sat and enjoyed the cool, beautiful surroundings and watched the 'beautiful people' walk by!
Worth a look - maybe not a drink!"
703,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Dated experience but great staff save this place.,"Like other reviews, I found this place to be the epitome of luxury and grandeur but the staff were a bit stand-offish for my taste to the point where they seemed aloof. For that reason I was going t give this place 4/5 except for one member of staff who was simply fantastic. Her name was Jasmin who is one of the concierges I believe - she knew absolutely everything without having to double check and found me a great Cantonese restaurant which was a bit off the beaten track - exactly what I was after. Always had a smile and really turned the whole experience around for me. 5/5 because of her. If she doesn't remember me then its because she must always be that good!"
704,Date of stay: November 2016,20,Sexist and Ageist,"Do not stay here if you're a single woman who looks under 35. I have never been treated with so much disrespect at any hotel, let alone a luxury hotel. My girlfriend and I chose this hotel because we have both had wonderful experiences at other Peninsula hotels. We thought this one would surpass the others, but it failed to deliver a five star experience in every regard.

The room, food, and service were all unimpressive. We had tea and asked to have the pastries we did not finish packed in a box, and they never bothered to do so. All the small details that distinguish a luxury property from a mid-range hotel were neglected. However, this would be a 4 star review had I not been commanded to move out of the way by one of the bellhops.

The first time I asked for a taxi, I was told to walk a few blocks down because it would be easier to catch one there. That's bad enough, but the second time I asked for a taxi, I was told to wait in the queue for guests of the hotel. I was waiting there when a bellhop ordered me to move so that the couple behind me who were staying at the hotel could get a taxi. I told him I had been waiting and should have the next one. He demanded to see my room key to prove I was staying at the hotel. He did not apologize when I produced it, but at least I caught the next taxi.

This would be a one star review if management did nothing to address the situation. However, they barely did anything to make up for everything that went wrong, and I know plenty of older men who have been taken seriously when they brought their concerns to management, so I know they could have done much more."
705,Date of stay: December 2016,40,Luxurious but not welcoming,"This is _the_ luxury hotel in HK, so I was really looking forward to my stay there. It's super luxurious, great location, and the staff are very friendly, but the overall feel is quite cold and unwelcoming. The rooms are almost sterile (I stayed in the old wing), and all the electronic gizmos were annoying. But my main critique is that there is no place to sit in any of the (gorgeous) public spaces. You come in from a hard day of shopping, and there's no couch or chair to sit down, catch your breath, wait for a friend, consult your guide book, or merely people watch. If you don't want to buy a drink in the lobby bar, all you can do is go straight to your room.

Compare to the Sofitel Metropole in Hanoi, where I also stayed on this trip. All the public spaces have friendly couches so that, as a guest, you feel like you _belong_ there. There's turndown service at night, with a macaron treat on your pillow. It really feels like a ""home away from home,"" which the Pen most definitely does not."
706,Date of stay: December 2016,50,The top hotel in all aspects,"Top service, facilities and atmosphere.

We had a suite in the old building and everything was as classy as you'd ever want. Champagne and fruit basket in your suite.

View looking at the planetarium and harbour beyond. Nothing else to ask for."
707,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Faultless luxury as you'd expect from the Pen,"This was the first hotel we stayed in on a trip to Australia and what a way to start the holiday!
Our room was a courtyard view which was fine as we could see some of the harbour and HK island plus the courtyard was decked out with 'floating stars' for Christmas.
The room was spacious and comfortable with a separate lobby area leading off to an equally spacious bathroom and separate toilet.
Only had breakfast one day which was fantastic, small things like the waiters folding your napkin when you return from the buffet set this hotel apart.
Overall a great experience, and being away from the UK for the Christmas period it was nice to smell the fresh pine from the giant Christmas tree in reception!"
708,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Style all the way,"It has been a dream to stay at the Peninsula in Hong Kong and it lived up to all expectations. The room was beautifully appointed, the bed comfortable, the food amazing. The breakfast was the best hotel breakfast I've ever had. The high tea was delicious and full of old world charm.

From the moment we arrived to when we left- Hazel from the front desk, made sure everything was taken care of. She is a huge asset to the hotel. I can't wait for the next visit!"
709,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Fantastic hotel and service,"This was our first stop of our Indochina trip and our first time to Hong Kong. We were aware of The Peninsula's excellent reputation and it certainly lived up to its reputation during our three night stay. It is opulent without being over the top and truely luxurious. We stayed in a Deluxe Room with a harbour view, room 2410, so on the 24th level of the 27 allocated to bedrooms. The view over to Hong Kong island was absolutely breathtaking especially at night when the place lights up.
A fantastic hotel with fantastic friendly service."
710,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Our favorite hotel in the world so far (seriously!),"We stayed here two nights and loved every minute of it. We booked through their website promotion and got upgraded to one of the larger city-view rooms on the 25th floor. We loved our room - very spacious, quiet and comfortable with every amenity you could ask for. Comfortable bed and pillows, great wifi and TV/free movies, fantastic huge marble bathroom (awesome water pressure!) with luxurious toiletries (we found an online listicle after we returned that praised the Peninsula as having one of the ""Top Ten Hotel Toiletries in the World"" - silly, but no lie!).

Everything from the room temperature to curtains can be controlled with the bedside iPad - we can't wait until more hotels follow suit. Right after you get settled in, your personal room attendant stops by with a pot of hot jasmine tea and gives you an overview of the room controls so you aren't left to your own device (so to speak).

We stayed here at the end of a long business trip with a lot of running around/travel/restaurants. We actually loved our room so much we ordered room service for both evenings and enjoyed every minute of it!

Staff were lovely and professional. We arrived early in the morning knowing we would be unable to check in, but they took our bags for us and, after a call early in the afternoon to tell us our room was ready, we stopped by to pick up our keys and our bags were already waiting for us in our room. Throughout our entire stay, the attention to detail by staff to meet our needs was beyond what we have experienced before. The Peninsula's service model should be a example to all hotels.

Morning buffet in the restaurant was fantastic and not to be missed. We did have a late a la carte breakfast in the lobby upon initially arriving, which allowed some awesome people-watching, but our food selections (Eggs Benedict and crepes) were so-so.

The gym was very well-appointed and had great views looking out over the water.

The hotel is located right next to the MRT station, and it is also super easy to get a taxi.

The only negatives (bear in mind we are setting the bar very high for this one!): wine is very expensive for the kind offered, and the wine in the minibar was priced stupid-expensive even by luxury hotel minibar standards. We ended up stopping at two places nearby (a grocery store a few blocks down Nathan and a wine shop at the iSquare a block away) and buying wine, and then requesting a bucket of ice with our room service meal. The lovely fruit plate in our room was a bit of a fail because most of the fruit was under ripe and meant apparently for decorative purposes only. In the afternoon, the lobby is busy busy busy with people having tea or standing in a long line waiting to be seated for tea, so it belies the tranquil mood of the rest of the hotel, and there's no seating anywhere if you want to hang out in the lobby - it's all full of tables.

We would unhesitatingly recommend the Peninsula to anyone wanting a luxury hotel experience in Hong Kong, and we will surely stay again on our next trip!"
711,Date of stay: January 2016,50,High Tea - A must!!,"While the Peninsula is consistently rated one of the best and has been since long before I lived in Hong Kong, visiting for High Tea is a true ""Imperial"" throwback. The service is impeccable, the setting quasi Victorian and the feel is worth the price. One can imagine while sipping their Earl Grey how Hong Kong was 150 years ago. Perhaps only a snapshot in time, but a memory one will carry forever."
712,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Amazing Hotel,"The hotel is luxury with amazing services. Room facilities are so excellent , with the iPad in every corner for you to put request for more water, ice and etc. Bed is so comfortable and clean.Location is great, centre of everything--Sogo is just opposite the hotel and walking distance for many restaurants and shopping centre."
713,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Amazing hotel!!,"This hotel is nothing short of amazing. My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and it really exceeded expectations. The staff are fantastic, the room was great, the pool is amazing, breakfast was excellent….really 10/10 with nothing bad to say about this hotel. It really was worth the money. We also got a lovely bottle of champagne, macaroons and chocolates for our honeymoon, what a lovely start to our trip!"
714,Date of stay: December 2016,30,"I wanted to love it, but it was just ok","I had heard so many amazing things about this historic hotel. The lobby felt like Las Vegas- which I hate... The front desk assigned me a smoking room.. which I also hate.
The room itself was fine, large enough, but felt a bit like a cruise ship.. The breakfast buffet felt cheap and cold. The one amazing service was the gym/spa- large, clean and with a beautiful view."
715,Date of stay: October 2016,50,High luxury,"The Peninsular is THE luxury hotel in Hong Kong. The service was efficient and helpful, without being over bearing. The rooms facilities are excellent, fully automated via iPad. The location is good, within walking distance of the river and shopping. Easy ferry service to the island within 10 min walking. Restaurants in the hotel are very good, although a little expensive, the quality was as you would expect from a first class hotel. The swimming pool is worth a visit just for the stunning view, it was never busy. The hotel does get busy for afternoon tea, so if you want one, you need to book - weekends are very busy with queuing throughout the afternoon."
716,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Highest of Teas,"What a unique experience to have High Tea in one of the most luxurious hotels in the world.
I would highly recommend you spoil yourself in this gorgeous grand hotel with the Classic Peninsula Tea plate for two.
Have a champers while you're at it too."
717,Date of stay: November 2016,50,First class all the way - they even have a nail dryer in the room!!!,"A truly memorable experience indeed. After checking in, a guest officer led us to our room and gave us a bit of ""tour"" of the room and guided us on how to use the high tech panels. Each room, i.e. the bathroom, the toilet, the bedroom, etc. have their own control panel to adjust the temperature, the volume of the music or to dim or brighten the lights. There was even a sink in the separate toilet room and a TV was mounted on the wall if we should decide to take a bath! The high ceiling with the lacquered furniture was a winning combination. The location was unsurpassed and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
718,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Beyond expectation!!!,"I recommend everyone to try the limosine package via hotel website promotion. It was a very impressing experience. The hotel staffs respond to every request in a blink .And everyone was a pro!! Thankyou nancy at the reception who made my mom so happy by her cheerful smile and upgrade. She address us by our name and when we lost our key, she said one minute!! And she did it faster than I could finish my sentence with my mom. Love you."
719,Date of stay: December 2016,40,A place full of history but could use a renovation,The hotel and staff is very lovely. The pool was amazing! Especially in the morning when no one is around. Taking a morning swim was amazing. But the place could seriously use a renovation! It's a bit oldish... and some of the rooms smell white a bit.
720,Date of stay: November 2016,50,"The perfect pick for service, location, amentities and staff!","The perfect pick of a hotel to start off a 2 week trip to Thailand. The Peninsula Hong Kong set the bar high. To begin with, communication pre arrival with hotel was immediate. We arranged for a Mercedes (much less expensive than Rolls) to pick us up as this service also included the meet and greet at the gate when we deplaned. I must commend the hotel for taking good care of me. While flying, the crew from Cathay was concerned that I had a possible DVT so they wired my hotel in-flight to let them know that I needed to be seen immediately upon arrival. When we arrived we were whisked through immigration, baggage, etc to a waiting car. On arrival to the Peninsula we were brought up to our room and checked in. Not even 5 minutes later a nurse arrived to check my leg. It was recommended that I go to the hospital to check further, so hotel staff accompanied us to Hospital ER department and facilitated check in and paperwork to expedite being seen. We were so impressed and more importantly grateful for all of the attention that we received to insure my good health.
As others have said, hotel rooms are well designed. As others have said, hotel is high tech; most importantly though is that all controls are intuitive so one does not need to read a manual to open the blinds or shut a light. That’s what is so impressive. US and USB Outlet/charging stations are plentiful so no need to bring convertor plugs. We never had tea as it seemed too much of a quiet commotion with all of the outsiders waiting on line. The only thing missing in the hotel for me was a place to meet our friends in the lobby to relax without eating or drinking. All in all, a wonderful hotel with a most caring staff to match! Thanks to the staff for the great care that I received."
721,Date of stay: December 2016,50,Best hotel stay I've ever had,"I must say this is the best hotel experience that I have ever had and I have tried many different hotels worldwide, but this has been the greatest experience. Every detail thought of and the attentiveness of staff is on another level. The luxuriousness of the rooms is amazing. I would definitely recommend the Rolls Royce hotel transfer as well"
722,Date of stay: November 2016,30,ATERNOON TEA AT THE PENINSULA HOTEL.,"We had been recommended to try this Iconic hotel's afternoon tea when we recently visited Hong Kong. It is best to arrive by 3pm we were told to avoid the queues!!. I asked our hotel which was the best time to arrive and they said 2pm is the best time.

We walked from our hotel which was nearby to arrive there by 2pm and there were already people queuing!!. I could not understand why this hotel does not accept any bookings.

One has to walk through the shopping arcade and take one's position in the queue whilst queuing admiring the shop windows perhaps which were adorned with with a variety of gifts, mainly jewellery.

Suddenly an orchestra started a variety of music whilst we waited for our seat at the many tables. However their choice of music could have been better!!. I really enjoy classical music but this was not very entertaining, there was a change of music when they placed a song from Frozen!!.

Eventually after an hour and 45 minutes we were shown to a table for two. This table was half way across the very large open plan tea hall I would call it not really my idea of comfort. The doors were constantly being opened and closed from the other side of the hall with hotel guests arriving with their suitcases !!.
We were offered the menu and quite quickly a lady came to take our order. However when one has queued for such a long time I think at least 10 minutes break should be granted after been offered the menu. I declined to order straight away!!.

We ordered tea for two which included coffee/teas, sandwiches ,scones,jam and cakes. It was served on a silver cake stand. The sandwiches were filled with tuna, very disappointing at least the hotel could have included smoked salmon !!. Also cucumber and ham. Well we were very disappointed all in all. The scones should have come out of the oven a bit sooner and were overcooked.

The variety of cakes were also a bit shameful. I spotted a cake which I though was filled with a fresh strawberry but it was actually a strawberry syrup. All in all the tea was not up to the standard of this Iconic Hotel or anywhere else that we have travelled in the world!!."
723,Date of stay: February 2016,50,The legend,"Undoubtedly, the peninsula hotel is the most luxury hotel in Kowloon side!. What I like about this hotel is about there legendary service, charming lobby and the most beautiful view in HKG! The view here is unmatched! Its high tea is the world renowned. Though their restaurants are very conservative but it's all scrumptious. The guest room is quite modern now. Besides! It's very convenient to go shopping in Kowloon!"
724,Date of stay: November 2016,50,A classic that lives up to its reputation,"The hotel long has had a five-star reputation and it lived up to its billing during our visit. Favorable Kowloon location, excellent rooms, appealing common areas, and The Bar was great fun. White-glove service as well. Expensive, but you know that already before you go there."
725,Date of stay: November 2016,50,The Best Service You Will Ever Receive,"I've always heard that the service at the Peninsula is the best. And I was not let down. This is a fantastic place.

My only complaint is that we could never get reservations in the restaurants, and didn't want to stand in the ridiculously long line for tea. Oh, and for some reason they ruined my cashmere/silk sweater by bleaching it and drying it.

But, we will be back. This place is fantastic."
726,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Old world charm,"This luxury hotel meets all your expectations for a top end place to stay....elegant rooms and restaurants, impeccable service, fabulous food and right in the heart of things on the Koeloon side so easy for business and touring"
727,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Always the best 😉,"There is just something about ""The Pennisular Experience"" great hotel, great food, exceptional service. As a regular guest it is like coming home. I always feel welcome at this hotel. The best hotel ever. Thank you."
728,Date of stay: November 2016,40,Afternoon Tea,"The Peninsula afternoon tea had been on my list for a while and knowing I would be visiting Hong Kong I was really looking forward to going. I went on a Saturday and arrived just after 1pm. The queue wasn't as long as I expected and I was shown to a table shortly after the service started at 2pm

The atmosphere is lovely and the service was friendly and attentive. I found the afternoon tea selection pleasant enough and well put together although perhaps I was expecting something with a bit more wow factor, especially in the desserts. They were all lovely but I just wasn't blown away like I have been with other afternoon teas

It was a nice way to spend an early Saturday afternoon though and I enjoyed the chamomile and orange blossom tea"
729,Date of stay: July 2016,50,A Privilege and a Pleasure,"The Peninsula is simply superb - pure luxury and indulgence. We stayed at the end of our recent visit to Hong Kong and glad we spent the last few nights in a room overlooking Victoria Harbour on the 15th Floor - what a view. They had even put together a special selection of toiletries and a toy for the baby. The bathroom is beautifully decorated with marble, offering a large bath, vanity sinks on either side of the bathroom and built in speakers ! The room is equipped with tablets to control everything from the curtains to the lights from the bed. It is definitely worth experiencing the splendour of the swimming pool with it's giant columns given a grand classical theme and view over Victoria Harbour with a sun terrace for guests."
730,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Very comfortable stay,"Stayed here as part of a weekend staycation. Booked a Deluxe Room and upgraded to a Deluxe Courtyard Room, and ended up on the 6th floor of the original wing, with beautiful views of Victoria Harbour.

The hotel has gone through renovations, and not only just the decor of the rooms. There are now hi-tech electronic panels all over the room which control the lighting, temperature, curtains...etc. These are linked to the three tablets (one on the desk, one on each side of the bed). The tablets offer a host of functionalities - including room service menus and introductions to hotel facilities. One can change the language preference of these panels to a variety of options, and that language change is immediately reflected on all the tablets as well as all the wall panels. That is truly impressive. I haven't seen any system like it anywhere else.

Room service breakfast was scrumptious - both the Chinese and the full Peninsula breakfast. Lunch sandwiches for room service were also delicious. No complaints.

Bathroom was nice in terms of size, with both a shower as well as a full bath tub - along with a TV facing the tub. The toilet was a separate stall outside the bathroom, with its own phone panel built into the wall.

Our room had its own fax machine, as well as a nice Nespresso machine in addition to the minibar and all. Plenty of glassware.

The vanity desk had a motorized mirror with lights which would rise up (and retract) at the push of a button. In addition to the usual hair dryer, the hotel also provided the ladies with a separate dryer for them to place their fingers underneath, to dry nail polish. This is a thoughtful touch I first saw in the Peninsula in Tokyo.

The only criticism I could level at the Peninsula is their environmental policy, or their seemingly lack of one. There was no option for guests to waive the daily changing of bed sheets or towels, as many hotels around the world do. I wish this is something that could be changed.

Otherwise we enjoyed our stay very much. Certainly very luxurious surroundings."
731,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Classic Elegant high-class 5-star Hotel,"Peninsula is one of the best hotels in HK, with a long history of heritage and the classic English-style interior design. Every restaurant inside is great and I tried all of them - Gaddi's, Felix, Chesa, Hotell Lobby lounge, you name it. They never disappoint you with the best service and unique food. The food there is definitely worth the price! For tourists, you should visit HK during Christsmas and check out the lighting decoration of Peninsula. It's definitely the highlighted landmark for the ""X'mas lighting exhibits""!"
732,Date of stay: November 2016,40,As expected!,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Peninsula, and loved it.
But with that price tag there should not be anything to complain about.
Service at check in and check out impeccable. Rooms and bathroom, spacious and very clean, good amenities.
Excellent location, minute to the subway and five mins walk to Star Ferry.
Shopping central.
High tea was a little disappointing....line up of tourists waiting for a seat but I think the tea there is over hyped! Very good buffet breakfast, value for money!
Lovely pool and view. Did not try the spa or restaurants in house."
733,Date of stay: November 2016,50,One of the World's Finest Hotels,"From the moment we deplaned, the excellent service began. The Peninsula sent someone to meet us and take our bags to our driver and one of their Rolls Royces for transfer to the hotel. After a very long flight, we were able to check in at 6 am! Our room on the 25th floor was incredible. We had lunch in the lobby, which is positively magical, with the delightful orchestra playing light classics from the balcony. We also had dinner at Felix and the classic Gaddi's. The concierge staff was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable. The breakfast buffet has the most international selection I've ever seen.
All in all, one of the best hotel experiences I have ever had. Highly recommended."
734,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Great Experience !,"We enjoyed everylittle bit of it and have been impressed by the high standard, the friendliness and wonderful service nd quality of food ! Breakfast on the 1st floor was outstanding and delicious. Thanks for your hospitality and all the best ! M. & F."
735,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"Outstanding service, wonderful pool and spa, welcoming ambiance","One of the few hotels I've stayed in that guaranteed connecting rooms, which is great for families. We arrived late and they accompanied us to our rooms and sped us through check-in.

We stayed in the new building. Loved the in-room power converters and chargers located on desks and nightstands. Room service was good, prompt, easy.

The service staff are exceptional and take their jobs seriously. The pool attendants monitored my kids swimming, which is nice. Lobby bar was the only place where service wasn't top-notch.

Breakfast buffet and high-tea all met expectations for a five-star hotel. No waiting or bad experiences."
736,Date of stay: November 2016,50,They say it sets luxury standards since decades : they are true,"When I arrived on a Sunday afternoon I thought I made a mistake : the hotel was very crowded. People taking pictures, waiting in line for the tea time. It was a tourist place not a hotel.
However passed the lobby, when you get to the front desk you feel like everything changed : calm, great staff, very kind people. A very nice men escorted us to two different rooms to chose from : a superior suite and a grand deluxe harbour view.
We were only two and we felt in love with the harbor view.
The room was luxury by itself. Everything was perfect and they even added a birthday cake for my wife's birthday.
Breakfast was among the best breakfast we have seen.
Pool with a view (same as the room) was very nice. Great tea time though not as we expected. Impeccable service.
A great hotel in a great city (being in Kowloon instead of Hong Kong was a real plus for us (not a mall hotel or a hotel in a very crowded area) and still 10-15 min away from the very center of Hong Kong."
737,Date of stay: November 2016,50,Classic Hotel,"We spent 3 nights in this hotel while visiting Hong Kong and were very happy with our stay. The hotel is a classic with modern updates but retains its historic feeling. The location is very convenient to all of the major attractions. The room was very comfortable and the iPad based system to control the temperature, lights, TV etc was great. The breakfast was fantastic as was the high tea we had. There is a nice bar with a fantastic view of the bay in top of the hotel
We will stay here again the next time we are in town"
738,Date of stay: November 2016,50,luxury and excellence,"Grand Harbour view suite room 2009 stay 31/10/16
incredible hotel, didn't want to stay on hong kong island this location is truly superb star ferry 5 mins walk and metro stations everywhere, the view across the harbour at night is stunning the hotel is pure luxury the staff attentive and kind I loved this hotel it seeped history with modern technology
top tip go to the pool and have lunch
only downside tourists flock to it so getting high tea was a bit of a await but this hotel shines
worth the money
I have been a loyal customer with peninsula in the far east and I will remain"
739,Date of stay: October 2016,30,Surprisingly very disappointing,"This being my first time staying at The Peninsula, it will also be my last. For all the hype, recognition and accolades this property gets, it's been a serious letdown.

Pros:
1. Historic hotel with lots of buzz.
2. Great location.
3. Excellent service (not all, see below).

Cons:
1. Specified non smoking room. I got a smoking room. Told them to change my room but could hear grumblings with front desk staff.
2. Certain manager/supervisor staff were very rude. Lobby managers sneered at me for wearing shorts. It's a hundred degrees in HK. Once they found out I'm a guest at the hotel their expressions changed. Keep it consistent boys.
3. Rooms starting age (especially the bathrooms).
4. Not worth the ""service"" they're renowned for. I've had better for a quarter the cost to stay here.

Live and learn. Never again."
740,Date of stay: December 2015,50,just wow,"One of the best hotels we've ever been to. Service was impeccable, the rooms were clean and well designed, and the hotel is in a great location in Kowloon.We loved the indoor pool and the service there. Great breakfast location with Central and Wanchai in full view. The staff was exception with every little detail.The rooms are a technological marvels, every thing is controlled by an I-pad next to each side of the bed, plus wall touch pads. Service is unbelievable"
741,Date of stay: March 2016,50,"In a Class of Its Own, Absolutely the Best","The Peninsula in Hong Kong has no equal. From the moment you are met at the airport, to the phenomenal service, amenities, rooms, tour guides, restaurants, to the time you are returned to the airport, the experience is like none other. WOW !!! We celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary at the Peninsula, where we felt like royalty. Words cannot properly describe how truly incredible our experience was. Should be on everyone's bucket list."
742,Date of stay: October 2016,20,"pretty lobby and public area, room is very average, spa sucks","pretty outlook but is it really how it seems to be?

pros:
+the lobby, restaurants and malls were all very pretty, fancy and clean.
+the room service and servers were all very helpful and friendly. :)
+nice view from the window
+good location if you are in hk for shopping

cons:
-with that price tag, i seriously expected something better.
-frankly the room we booked were just alright, nothing impressive or bad enough to complain.
-but the spa oh my god the product they used wasnt moisturizing at all
-and both our massagist, even tho their attutide was kind but their technique and skills were horrible. ( we didnt even pick the cheapest ones)
-they close ALL the public toilets IN ALL FLOORS during midnights, so if your partners using the toilet thers nothing you can do..ive never had this experience from all the hotels ive been to its quite unacceptable to me :/

i would recommend sticking to the restaurants and not the room, and please stay away from the spa."
743,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Brilliant,"One of the best hotels we've ever been to. Service was impeccable, the rooms were clean and well designed, and the hotel is in a great location in Kowloon. Our boys had welcome kits available for them, with the Peninsula teddy bears, a picture book, and robes included. The first night they gave them juice too, while there was green tea for the adults. The automated smart home system was easy to use.

Plus, if you booked a suite they check you in in your room! Which is so SO appreciated after a 12 hour flight. First five star hotel we've been to that does this and it made its way on our favorites list for that reason alone.

If you're a fan of walking, we recommend the Kowloon area. Hong Kong is fun, make the most of your stay!

ps. We stayed here March 2014."
744,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Amazing as Always ! !,"This was our second trip to Hong Kong this year and we specifically went to stay at The Peninsula. It can be a little pricey but is well worth it. If you can't stay your whole visit, at least try a night or two. The rooms are a technological marvels, every thing is controlled by an I-pad next to each side of the bed, plus wall touch pads. Service is unbelievable, my wife asked for an iron and ironing board and it was delivered within seconds and when the person brought them in, asked what it was my wife wanted her to iron. We were even invited to the first ""Movie under the Stars"" on the roof of the hotel, complete with food and drinks. Amazing! The Star Ferry terminal is just down the street, an easy walk and the ride over to Hong Kong island is only a few minutes. Subway station is right out the back door. Don't be put of that it's across the harbor in Kowloon. Amazing hotel, will always return."
745,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Best place to stay in Hong Kong,"We recently visited Hong Kong are were even stuck at the hotel for a full day due to typhoon Haima. The hotel has outstanding facilities, the lobby by itself is very impressive, the room was beautiful and large and the views excellent. Service and attention to every detail, including food is top notch. They even managed to made being unable to go anywhere due to the typhoon a pleasurable experience.
Maybe the only parts I would suggest to improve would be their restaurant Felix and maybe adding another bar or expending ones they have.
Felix was too expensive for what they offer. Both, food and service were spotty at best. Some parts of the menu were excellent and others pretty bland. Also service was very slow, they confused our orders and we needed to order drinks and bread several times before we got them."
746,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Every last detail,I arrived before the normal check-in time and obviously the room wasn't ready. However they did process the checkin and reassured me that I will have priority in getting a room cleaned and be available as soon as possible. They were true to their word and surprisingly I was even given an upgraded to a room facing the Hong Kong side. The room itself was fantastic quality and it was thought out to the last detail. To me this hotel is more tailored to the people who only accepts the very best. I loved the valet box so you don't even need to open the door for small deliveries. Since I had kids in my booking they even left some sweets for my kid and robe to fit them. We used the pool and it had fantastic views of the habour. The beer took a while as I ordered some food and would have expected them to bring this separately. However the drink was brought out with the food which made the beer abit flat. Unfortunately it was only a short visit to attend a wedding so I didn't get a chance to try out their restaurants but I am sure it would be good. I would definitely come back and recommend this hotel to anyone who is coming to Hong Kong. Obviously there are cheaper hotels but nothing compares to the quality and attention to detail.
747,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Pen-nies worth,"Stayed at The Peninsula for three full days on our way to the Philippines. From we arrived late in the evening to our departure, we were spoiled in any possible way. Big habour view room with a huge bed, large bathroom and nicely decorated. The pool area is fabulous - outside sunbeds and a large indoor pool. Fitnessroom is well equiped and all types of work-out is possible. In terms of dining - the Felix and the Spring garden are recommendable. We had both lunch and dinner at the traditionalle Chineese Spring garden. All in all three lovely days and I would recommend this place to anyone."
748,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Superb,"You know when you stay at the Peninsula that there is nothing to complain about. It is pure luxury. Superb service. Stayed here 8 years ago was wonderful then so even nicer now. We were upgraded to a Harbour deluxe room. Stunning view even though in the middle of a mild typhoon. The room, bathroom amenities are flawless. My only complaint is I could have stayed longer. Breakfast was included. No complaint there. If one can it's worth every penny spent. Highly recommend it"
749,Date of stay: October 2016,50,High Tea,"I went to the Peninsula for high tea at 5:00 and it was an experience I'll never forget. The tea is served in the lobby and as I was alone, it was a great opportunity for people watching as I enjoyed delicious morsels-- tender beef on a soft roll, salmon roe in an edible crust/cup, dainty cucumber tea sandwiches and the best scones that I have ever tasted. There were many varieties of tea to choose from and I love my Moroccan herbal mint tea."
750,Date of stay: September 2016,50,DETAILS DETAILS DETAILS,"This place does it all right down to the very last detail! I recently was on vacation with my boyfriend at the beginning of September. My favorite part of the trip was staying at this beautiful hotel! The service is exceptional and so accommodating. The room was well thought out and equipped with all needs. Blow dryer plugged into the drawer, espresso machine that you do not need to add water... very convenient!!!

A must do is the English afternoon tea in the lobby! But be sure you are dressed to impress :)"
751,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"Excellent hotel, excellent service","High end hotel well situated in Hong-Kong Kowloon. The rooms are very well equipped. A few good restaurants and bars are available in the hotel, as well as a luxury commercial gallery.
Good spa.
Very nice view from the top of the building.
The service is perfect, very professional with high attention to details.
Only (little) issue: the building is huge and complicated, so you get lost very often."
752,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Amazing place to stay,"We stayed at the Peninsula Bankok last year and met a family who told us we must stay at the Pen if we went to Hong Kong - we can see why !! We arrived very early after a flight from London and the staff did everything they could to get our room ready early so we could settle in. The view from our room on the 22nd floor was stunning and the room was spacious with every luxury. We ate breakfast and dinner in the Verandah restaurant with a wonderful choice of food every time. We had a very minor problem with a window blind but a call to reception had this fixed within 15 minutes! Excellent service. This ""Grand Old Lady"" of HK can only be described as opulent. We were made to feel very at home and were greeted by name every day."
753,Date of stay: October 2016,50,The peninsula Hong Kong- recommended,"A friend and I had a stop off in Hong Kong for a couple of days on the way back from Europe and wanted to spoil ourselves for the last couple of nights of travel. The peninsula provided that experience. Excellent room, recently refurbished. Lots of space with a lobby entry for suitcases and a spacious bathroom, separate toilet. Excellent staff. Indeed a 5 star experience. The only area of improvement I can think of is some seating in the lobby- it is all restaurant with nowhere to sit and wait for friends."
754,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"ONCE AGAIN, BEST IN CLASS, MY 4TH VISIT.....wow wow wow Love","I just returned from 4 nights at The Peninsula Hong Kong, it gets better every visit. I love it even more !!!

The hotel is so classy, the staff so amazing....from the bellman, porters, the concierge...too many to name but Echo and Michael stand out. They always remember my name and I have only been there 4 times in two years. The entire converge staff impress me everyday.!

The front desk staff, all so welcoming and professional, especially Matteo who is one of the first people i encountered two years ago, always so kind and consistent.

The wait staff in the Lobby(ricky) and all in the Verandah, these professionals never miss a step....they serve, the treat people like they matter and the service is excellent considering the volume of business this hotel does each day. I am so impressed

The spa staff, Sumi who always remembers me from a previous visit and so kind and the massage professionals and estheticians...amazing

What is it that makes the Peninsula so special? I believe the hotel is run like a small family, you can feel the warmth and welcome the minute you walk in the large glass doors....you feel like you are in the luxury of the modern word but can tell the history in the hotel goes back so many years. The decor and architecture so chic.

i arrived early from an overseas flight and they were kind enough to have a room ready for me with some breakfast treats, I know this was a special treat just for me, but i hear from so many of the guests ow impressed they are with the personalization made by the hotel ...truly wonderful!

i love the rooms and the pool is gorgeous, the fitness room is amazing. I had an opportunity to see a couple of the suites in the hotel and if you get a chance, make sure to reserve a suite, simply divine and out of this world views and comfort

Most important part of this hotel is the guest relations team, who never seem to fail my expectations. Alice Chan who is the director of guest relations is one of the hardest working people i have ever met ! she goes out of her way, no matter how busy she is to make the guests feel satisfied. Wonderful, kind woman. Her staff is all extremely impressive and consistent and makes sure the guests are totally happy and looked after. Henry and Chris and Keiko....all wonderful in ways i cannot express. so thank you to everyone...

anyone considering the Peninsula over another choice should pick this hotel, it blows me away each and every visit. I love it , everyday!!!!!"
755,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Peninsula Paradise,"I've been staying at this hotel for forty years. Still first class, A+, elegant and luxurious.
Service is perfect. Very attentive staff who seemed genuinely interested in our comfort. We ate at the hotel's Chinese restaurant and breakfast at the hotel each day. This place is not cheap, but it does not portend to be a ""value"" hotel. Enjoyed our stay thoroughly."
756,Date of stay: October 2016,50,Spectacular luxury,"One of the best city hotels I have visited. Even given the size, within 24 hours many of the staff know you by name. Rooms are right up to date and well appointed. Hotel is luxurious with a great gym and pool. Many rooms have amazing views back to HK. Breakfast is simply excellent, a wonderful buffet and other things cooked to order. My wife said the bed was the most comfortable she has ever slept in, and she is well travelled. Nothing was too much trouble.I would return in a heartbeat."
757,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Classic luxury,"The Peninsula Hong Kong has a reputation as one of the best hotels in the world and this is well deserved. Luxury is the word you would use to describe every aspect of this great hotel. Excellent service, great staff, beautiful, comfortable room, great food. Can't wait to return."
758,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Style plus Elegance what more can you ak for,"As we would have expected our eexperience at the H K Pen was all that we could have hoped for. As our flight was not due in until late night we arranged for a hotel car. From the moment we disembarked and was greeted by a hotel person we glided through the vast airport, baggage claim and immigration and then into the waiting Mercedes. Way to go
The hotel as opposed to so many ""modern""steriotyped hotels whilst having a distinct colonial look also affords its guests the most comptehensive electronic systems for their in room use. Of course our room was great. Food in particular the breakfast buffet at the Erandah ws excellant. Whatever your taste might be you can be assured you will be well satisfied by the offerings og that buffet. Nextt the The Felix at the top of the tower great view in a room designed by Plillie Stark, What could be better There are two world famous afternnon teas one of which is in the lobby of the Hong Kong Peninsula. During our stay we of course enjoyed the experience on two occasions. If you have never experienced it Try it Your Like it.. Lasly I would be remiss if I failed to make mention of the wonderful staff .team. At all levels they showed, professionlism, expertise, and warmth. ."
759,Date of stay: September 2016,50,elegant,"great example of colonial chic.......really nice staff and so efficient .the lobby area with the
classical band/quartet (didn't count them)was a delight....only yards away from the hustle of the star ferry terminal."
760,Date of stay: October 2016,40,Fab views!!,"Great Stark design, service and fabulous view, not to be missed!! Arrive early to make sure you get a good seat. Some cocktails are a bit light in quantity compared to other places e.g the Mandarin Oriental. So might be better order a G&T or a glass of wine..."
761,Date of stay: October 2016,50,"High Tea - good service, great gluten free option","We enjoyed high tea on a Monday afternoon at the Peninsula. The staff were very accommodating and friendly. Although 48 hours notice is required for the gluten free option, this means you don't have to wait long for a table when you arrive so it's well worth it. A very nice experience, lovely food."
762,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Simply Amazing,"We stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong for four days before boarding the Cunard Queen Elizabeth,

We had a gorgeous room overlooking Victoria Harbor - a ringside seat for the light show each night. The room and bathroom came with amazing amenities and all the modern conveniences. The bathroom was one of the most beautiful and palatial I have ever seen.

The buffet breakfast was an outstanding mixture of American, Continental and Oriental items. We left full every morning.

The restaurants and bars are first rate. The public rooms are beautiful - harking back to the time when the Peninsula was the terminus of the Oriental express.

The staff truly looks out for their guest every need.

Will definitely stay here again whenever I next find myself in Hong Kong"
763,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Elegant classic afternoon tea - MUST WAIT IN LINE EARLY!,"Had a wonderful ""Tiffany's"" themed afternoon tea set in the lobby area of The Peninsula. I forget exactly how much it was, but it was around $85-90 USD for 2 people. Each treat was presented beautifully and tasted delicious - the warm scones and clotted cream were excellent. All the utensils/teapots were British sterling silver and service was top notch. Note that the hotel does not take reservations for afternoon tea - it is on a first come, first serve basis. Plan to arrive around 1:30 or earlier if you want to get in the first seating as it opens at 2pm. Once the first seating is full, you will see people queuing up for 1 hr+ for a spot. Also recommend asking for seating in the main lobby; there is additional seating on the second floor in the back but it has very little charm compared to the grand lobby."
764,Date of stay: September 2016,50,"Wonderful location, hotel and stay in Kowloon Hong Kong","If you are looking for a wonderful oasis in the middle of Kowloon's hustle and bustle this is the Hong Kong's finest.
Perfectly situated close to MTR, Star Ferry, Shopping and Nathan Road you can't go wrong with great access to enjoy your HK stay.
This hotel is 5 stars for a reason. Upon entry the lofty high ceiling reminisce to ""colonial stylings"" with echoes to other grand hotels such as the Raffles hotel Singapore.
Service is very attentive upon check-in. We required octopus cards for the MTR. Staff went out and purchased them for us and they were delivered to our room within 10 min of our arrival to the room. No extra fee other than the cost of the cards! On a previous stay they did the same in organising visas to visit Shen Zhen.
We opted for an upgrade to a higher floor to enjoy the view of the harbour. With the bed facing the windows it was great to watch junks slowly pass by while enjoying the lights of Hong Kong.
The room was well sized with a great bathroom that features separate shower, toilet and a bath that was able to fit two people with ease.
Supplied toiletries were luxurious as well as a great gift soap container that is a nice memento of the stay.
The room was very modern with all lights, the curtains and climate controlled via panels near the doors as well as larger panels by the phones.
Beside each side of the bed were power points in multiple international forms as well as a charging station on one side. It had iPhone, USB, micro-usb and other chargers so I was able to charge phone, iPad as well as camera at the same time.
Given how hot and humid our visit was the air-conditioning was very effective, even a little cool when we arrived.
The hotel offered free wifi which connected easily (last name and room number) and was faster than my cable service at home in Australia.
Upon arrival we were greeted with a fruit tray as well as hot tea served by the room staff.
Room staff were very attentive, each time we left the room we came back to fresh towels and the bed remade.
Breakfast was part of our rate and was served on the 1st floor. Lots of choice with local fruit, juices as well as a great juice cocktail as a ""wake up"" (orange, ginger and a little olive oil from what I remember).
There was a fresh egg station as well as a great Asian selection and fresh congee.
Cereal as well as bakery items were fresh and well chosen.
Tea and coffee came hot and fast. The coffee was so so however the tea was wonderful Served in a silver pot with strainer, exactly as the high tea downstairs (highly recommended).
Departure from the hotel was easy. Room service handed our multiple bags and organised a car to deliver to the airport. Upon arrival to the airport we were greeted by 2 Peninsula staff with trollies who delivered our bags to the checkin. Another unexpected surprise and a fantastic way to end our Hong Kong stay.
Highly recommended."
765,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Total luxury!,"I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough. We had a fantastic stay here and thourghly enjoyed everything about this classic yet extremely modern hotel. It has moved with the times regarding technology but has retained its colonial charm. Our room was superb with iPads controlling everything. We had meals and afternoon tea in the lobby and the service and food were excellent. We had breakfast everyday in the hotel and that too was first class. We used the pool which was a haven in the midst of the busy city. There is absolutely nothing I can fault about this hotel. The staff and quality of staff service is outstanding and every member of staff we came into contact with was friendly, courteous and professional. Special mention must be given to Martin on reception who couldn't do enough for us and Kelvin on conceiage who was an absolute star arranging things for us including the Rolls Royce transfers. We had a wonderful stay and would thourghly recommend the hotel. Thank you."
766,Date of stay: September 2016,50,High Tea is a MUST!,"One of the loveliest afternoons we had during our weeks stay in Hong Kong. Excellent food, tea and atmosphere and worth the calories!
Hong Kong is very different nearly 20 years on from 1997 and the Peninsula is one of the last places left of British influence.... sit back enjoy and pretend it's the turn of the century!"
767,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Fantastic,"One of the best Hotel of Hong Kong. All is perfect: service, Suite, also RR taxi service. This hotel is very expensive, but if you need the best you must pay for it. You can ask for a lot of room services and also restaurants are very high level."
768,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Afternnon Tea,"Never stayed but visited twice for the fabled afternoon tea.
Last time we were on the Queen Elizabeth world cruise and started the queue for that days tea at about one and a half hours before the serving.We wanted to get a choice of table.After about an hour in the queue we were asked by the floor manager to take any table since he had seen us waiting patiently at the head of the growing queue.
We chose our table and were offered any tea from the extensive menu which we had before the food was served and fresh tea ordered.
The hotel is voted top service in the world and I agree."
769,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Best high tea ever!,"We recently visited the Peninsula hotel with the sole intention of trying the world famous afternoon tea. This has been something my wife and I have wanted to do for many years, and the stay in Hong Kong was our perfect opportunity.

There are many superlatives used to describe this hotel and having sat there for a few hours each one is definitely worthwhile. The afternoon tea menu starts at 2pm, however the line for a seat will be quite long by then, we arrived at 1:25pm and were already will back in the line. That said we were seated shortly after 2pm and the afternoon tea menu operates until 6pm.

The staff were fabulous and the hotel was simply beautiful, the interior architecture was just brilliant and a true reflection of a bygone era. In addition the numerous prestige cars rolling through the front driveway was worth a look for the avid motoring enthusiast.

Back to the food - it arrived on a three tier stand and it was full of a range of mouth water delights, each sample was deliciously devoured and savoured, the tea was endless and I think we both consumed our far share over the couple of hours we spent enjoying the experience.

The tea event costs about $185HKD but is well worth the money. It was something we always wanted to do and there are definitely no regrets. I would highly recommend this venue and afternoon tea to anyone who loves class and sophistication, we will done this again next time we visit Hong Kong."
770,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Best hotel in Hong Kong,"Breathtaking views, competent and discreet staff, immaculate rooms and presentation, a fabulous selection of delicious restaurants, a luxurious spa, fabulous Peninsula label products, a great convenient location, a wonderful fleet of cars and amazing bed linen.

Unrivalled and iconic. One of my favourite hotels worldwide!"
771,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Iconic hotel,I would rate this as the most iconic hotel of hongkong which has seen history of many decades. Located near to promenade one can see the beautiful hongkong skyline. The high tea at this hotel is very famous and visitors line up to get a table. The rooms are classy & elegant. Atop there is helipad which has daily hongkong helicopter sight seeing tours. Must visit & enjoy the experience of this hotel
772,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Devine,"8 nights of incredible service and luxury these guys epitomise the word service
nothing was too much
Staff that are polite attentive and most of all they seemed happy
Fabulous luxury rooms
Excellent location
For shopping , sightseeing , food
Incredible views you could sit and watch Victoria harbour all day long
Brilliant Spa / Pool area
Great Gym
Wicked Bar
I could go on and on
Just try it you won't be disappointed
apart from when it's time to leave
Just an Awesome Hotel"
773,Date of stay: August 2016,40,A Classic. Great 5 Star Service but the Lobby was just too full and crowded.,"Front desk staff was very helpful and courteous. The room was quite complete, spacious and very comfortable. It has retained its classic design but with very subtle and fitting upgrades and enhancements. Breakfast was great -- a truly comprehensive spread. Gym was also quite complete and updated.. Only downside was how full and busy the lobby was. Maybe there was some promotional high tea special or it could have been the season but it was not very pleasant to come home to a crowded hotel lobby after a day of shopping..."
774,Date of stay: September 2016,40,A pleasant stopover in Hong Kong,"Just finished a three day stopover at the Peninsula. The location of the Peninsula is in a great location in Tsim Tsa Tsui on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong and you can easily walk to the Star Ferry Terminal (to travel to Hong Kong Island), China Ferry Terminal (if travelling to Macau) and to every high end brand you can imagine without venturing to the island side of Hong Kong.
Our room was in the original building and located on the second floor, with the floor very quiet and peaceful. This was in stark contrast to the hotel lobby where it was very busy and many non-hotel guests walk through due to the Peninsula Shopping Arcade and much lauded high tea.
Our room was absolutely lovely for a three day stay. The room was decorated in oriental chic tones, and we were impressed with how the hotel has integrated technology to control every part of the room. A minor criticism would be that housekeeping wanted to service the room before breakfast each morning, whilst we were getting ready to go out which was an inconvenience to send them away or have to leave the room. The housekeeping service however, was impeccable.
We were also able to have our breakfast each day in The Verandah, enjoy cocktails at Felix and dinner at Spring Moon. In all three locations the service, beverages and food quality was outstanding.
I would definitely recommend the Peninsula if wishing to stay on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong."
775,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Unquestionably the best!,"Living in Hong Kong I eat out often and am a fairly regular frequenter of the Peninsula. This year I have eaten in Chesa, the Verandah, the Lobby and Gaddis. The Pen has exceptional standards yet they always seem to surpass my expectations. They have recently won a global award for service, to add to the best hotelier award secured by their inspirational GM Rainy Chan a few years ago. The surroundings are unbeatably elegant, the food - varied, well presented and leaving no taste buds unturned, and the personal service unmatched - even in Hong Kong."
776,Date of stay: September 2016,30,Disappointed,"I stayed at the peninsula for 3 nights September 8-10th , after visiting main China for one week . I feel there is a lot excitement and expectation build up around this hotel . Many years ago the room technology was impressive but now days every hotel in the Peninsula category has it .

Pro : excellent service

Con: lack of space in lobby is just a big open restaurant , a lot of foot traffic from non hotel guess for pictures and tea time ,not a hotel to enjoy peace and quiet time . Too many shops taking up space , extremely commercial to the point that in my opinion the lack of a decent bar is do to all the shops taking the space that could be used for guess services . The Felix bar needs to be closed an remodel the stool chairs very uncomfortable the view obscured from wooden blinds . The Peninsula Hong Kong needs to take a look at the fantastic bar and guess spaces at the Peninsula Shanghai.
If you want to be in the Titanic era this is the hotel to stay at."
777,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Exceptional hotel in Hong Kong,"Before our visit, we were in contact with the concierge who provided a super efficient service which set the scene very nicely. We were greeted at the airport and had chosen to travel in one of their green Rolls Royces - start your visit with this luxury! As we glided up to the hotel, the charming Nancy from the front desk was waiting to escort us to our room for check in. Minutes after she left, some tea arrived. Having deliberated over choosing the harbour view room, we were glad we had, particularly in the evening when Hong Kong comes alight. Every detail seemed to have been considered in the design of the room - built in coffee machine, vanity mirror that rises electronically from the dressing table, and nail dryer. The bathroom was beautiful, had his and hers sinks and Oscar de la Renta products. Location-wise, the hotel is perfect for exploring Kowloon but also easy access for the iconic star ferry to Hong Kong island (a must do). We felt the hotel thoroughly lived up to its expectations for having the best service in the world. If possible, when booking, include breakfast - the buffet caters for all is a feast. We ate at Spring Moon which was superb, with very helpful staff. Afternoon tea is a must. If you are staying in the hotel, you can book a table. The pool is big enough to swim lengths in, and although we didn't use it, the gym looked well equipped. This hotel made our visit to Hong Kong truly memorable."
778,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Best lunch experience,"This review is only about the lunch buffet at the Verandah restaurant on the level one (up two flights of stairs) We made online reservation a couple of weeks ago, which led us to be seated promptly on Friday, 9/2nd.

The hotel is absolutely stunning with its high ceilings and amazing decor, and the service is just exquisite, and that made our whole experience more special and memorable. Plenty of fresh and delicious food is nonstop provided so you better pace yourself. The quality of ingredients and selections of food are outstanding. My hubby and I really enjoyed every bite. Another great thing about the service was that we weren't rushed although it was packed.

PS
HKD$468 on Mon-Fri vs HKD$788 on weekends & public holidays

779,Date of stay: October 2015,50,"Gorgeous View to see the beautiful sea, best staying !","It's a famous brand hotel and certainly I and my friends did expect more !
From the moment to walk into the hotel, lobby, room, restaurant....the equipment were all great. We booked the room at higher rate to see the wonderful sea view, that was really unforgettable experience to have the breakfast, watching the view.
Overall saying, it's great and I was happy the hotel didn't disappoint us. Highly recommend to book a room with ocean view to make the great memory."
780,Date of stay: September 2016,50,"Miracles @ The Lobby, The Peninsula HK","Encountering the simple miraculous wild mushroom soup complete with fabulous bread & butter is worth the trip in rain across the tunneled mass transit !

What is more to pamper one's palate by a brimful glass of strawberry milkshake cum its iconic cheesecake!

But never miss out its initial impact of a glass of Virgin Mary to begin your afternoon idling at the far corner of The Lobby, watching the time and tide passing by for a few hours to tell you: Life is worthwhile to go on ...and on ...till time to relish its gorgeous in-house Moon Cakes in a week or two !"
781,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Best of best,"Our family stayed there for three nights, with the third night complementary. The service was always efficient and excellent. The rollaway bed linen was designed for children. All the lighting, room temperature, room service are controlled via tablets. The bathroom was huge with TV in front of bathtub. The room also had all kinds of chargers which was very convenient. Different complementary fresh fruit was provided every day. Turndown service didn't come automatically every night but we were OK. The swimming pool has a very nice harbour view and is very tranquil. The complementary breakfast at the Lobby was the best we had ever had. The concierge was very helpful and efficient. It was like living in the White House."
782,Date of stay: October 2015,30,Has been,"I was there in July 1974, it was then a true Palace, elegant and with something special,I staid again in 2015 and find a place dedicated to the Chineses '''Nouveaux riches''no more Harbour view in the historical part, a huge Tower at the back looking like any modern hotel, the rooms are fine, the staff is uninterested by the guests, there is no place to seat and relax as if you seat in the lobby you are pestered by waiters wanting you to purchase a drink and or some food.
No more class just greed"
783,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Just amazing!,"I had the opportunity to stay 2 nights there on a business trip, it was an amzing stay.
The great attention to details and the very nice staff makes it a memorable experience.
Rooms are great, even without an Island view!
The location is perfect as well and very convenient."
784,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Best in the world.,"Not much to say to one of the best hotels in the world.
Perfect Location
Excellent Service
Professional and attentive staff
Great Spa and pool
Delicious food
Etc, etc, etc

Will return and highly recommend it!"
785,Date of stay: September 2016,50,Luxury,"We stayed here two nights with our two little kids. You could be perfectly happy never leaving the hotel. The pool was warmer than most hotel pools, good for the kids. The food was delicious. The service was the best part, they treat their guests with respect and kindness. And the room was very comfortable. So glad we could stay here!"
786,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Truly splurge-worthy. Top 10 hotel in the world,"I could make this one of the shortest review ever: This is a Top 10 hotel in the world; you absolutely need to stay there when you go to Hong Kong. That said, I will add some additional thoughts. First, the Peninsula is expensive, but while I would not suggest this very often, it is absolutely splurge worthy. I can't even imagine staying anywhere else when I'm in Hong Kong. While the Peninsula is on the Kowloon area, rather than on the glitzier island, given the service and experience, it's a tiny price to pay. Rooms are beautiful, and full of all the modern technology, even though you are staying in a nearly 100 year old institution. The service at the hotel is really over the top, and I just can't say enough about it. While it is very famous, and at this point a bit touristy, everyone really should do High Tea at the Peninsula; it's really fun, and is a wonderful respite after all of the hustle and bustle outside. Additionally, I would HIGHLY recommend Gaddi's, the formal French restaurant, for dinner. It is truly a throwback with the dress code and the band, but the food and atmosphere are just spectacular. The punch line is, don't even consider staying anywhere else when you are in Hong Kong"
787,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Great!,"One of the best of the great hotels. We had a suite with a sensational view to Hong Kong and a perfect service . The pool also with a great view was amazing. The breakfast was nice, but not so extraordinary but unfortunately the Chinese dinner in the restaurant was a disappointment."
788,Date of stay: August 2016,50,The finest service in a modern yet classic hotel,"We have stayed in many extremely good hotels in North America and Europe and have found that the bar keeps getting raised higher and higher. Our recent visit to Hong Kong was our first trip to Asia and our expectations were high given the vaunted reputation of Asian hotels. On the one hand, The Peninsula is THE iconic hotel in Hong Kong. On the other hand, it is also an old hotel so there was some concern over that.

It turns out that The Peninsula delivers a proper, traditional Asian-hotel experience but it is the most technologically up-to-date hotel we have ever seen. The exterior and the lobby are exactly as you would expect but our room was a beautiful combination of Hong Kong style with the highest system integration. There are no light switches in the room. All switching, temperature control and drapery adjustments are controlled by at least eight small LCD wall panels and three larger iPad-like devices. The phone even has a voice over IP button that allows you to call anywhere in the world for free.

The bathroom was configured with his and hers sinks and vanities, and separate bathtub and shower. The bathroom is a welcome and complete refutation of the tendency of some modern hotels that try to incorporate the bathroom into the rest of the room. The bathrooms at The Peninsula are physically and audibly their own space (as it should be).

We were met at the airport by one of The Peninsula’s 14 green Rolls-Royces. This is no mere car service. The hotel clearly has a special arrangement with the airport since a representative meets you at the end of the jetway, the moment you emerge from the aircraft. This person then stays with you through customs and baggage claim and then takes you to the waiting car. Check-in is done in the room so the front desk at The Peninsula is unusually small for such a large hotel.

The eighth-floor infinity pool was beautiful and an absolute necessity in Hong Kong in August. Like everything else at The Peninsula, the pool was maintained to the absolute highest standard.

People will argue the merits of whether to stay in Hong Kong proper or Kowloon where The Peninsula is. We had no regrets with our choice of location. The bustle of Kowloon is right outside your door. Hong Kong island is a 10 minute MTR ride and the markets of Mong Kok are all of 12 minutes away.

We had breakfast the first morning in The Lobby. There was nothing wrong with that meal but the real fun was eating upstairs at The Verandah for every other breakfast. They had a wide range of offerings for western and eastern taste but we skewed hard to the east and enjoyed the treats from the steaming wicker baskets.

The concierge desk always gave us good dining advice. We wanted to have an Italian meal one night and they gave us several good options. When we went to Macau for a day, they gave us the name of an excellent Portuguese-Macau restaurant (Restaurante Litoral).

We visited a number of other top-end hotels during our stay. The Peninsula may be the oldest of the hotels we saw, but it is also the most up to date. There is no reason we wouldn’t go back there on a future trip."
789,Date of stay: August 2016,50,The place to stay in Hong Kong without doubt,"We stayed 3 nights in August. The room we were given had every possible amenity and gadget. The bathroom was one of the best that I have had in a hotel. All in the best possible taste. The rooms have a lot of style as does the hotel. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. We had breakfast each day on the first floor and it was very good. One night we ventured up to the restaurant on the top floor, Felix. We had an exceptional meal there, with a great view over the Harbour. The hotel is not cheap, but then if you want class, luxury and good service you have to pay for it,"
790,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Sublime,"The Peninsula Hotel, you are Outstanding!!!
Tagging along with my husband who had business on mainland China for 2 days was an absolute joy because when I was alone, and without even knowing so, every single person who wears The Pen uniform makes you feel at home and I was never really alone. Exquisite detail, a warm and inviting atmosphere where nothing is too much trouble. We can't thank you enough for the beautiful week we had at the most sensational hotel we've ever stayed at."
791,Date of stay: October 2015,50,"Classic Style, everything is perfect.","Had a 3/4 nights stay and wish we would go again.

Room was very nice and classic, the bed was very comfortable, especially the white and blue tone were match perfectly.
I love the bathroom, it was huge, big mirror, a big glass(?) in front of the bathtub and some sunlight can come in, was a pleasure to have a candle-light bath. haha

Swimming -- is also one of the best in HK? It is not big but nice with the harbour view. Spa is amazing but sure is expensive, while if you want to have a memorial experience with your love one. :)

Overall the experience was amazing."
792,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Dad in a wheelchair - brilliant service,"We have stayed at the Peninsula so many times. We adore it. \Free VOIP phone and wifi. Beautiful luxurious rooms and service second to none. It is another world and has the best service of any hotel in the world.

This time we bought my parents for a holiday from Australia as a surprise. Dad was not very mobile.

I just wanted to say how brilliant they were with my 82 year old dad. He had broken his hip and leg 7 weeks prior and had major operations and the Peninsula organised a wheelchair and were simply spectacular with he and my Mother. Nothing was too hard.

So I would highly recommend staying here if you had a wheelchair!

On a different note - beware Hong Kong can be difficult for wheelchairs in old buildings unless you stay in the streets. Don't go below ground as many disabled lifts are not available for much of the day because they use them for rubbish removal and they stink and are often full of refuse."
793,Date of stay: November 2015,50,One of the Best Hotel in the World!!!!!,"It was one of my dream to stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong, the legendary ""Grande Dame of the Far East"". What an experience, from start to finish, everything was seamless.
The room product is incredible with the latest technology, and of course very easy to use, this is the most important thing.
The ""Oscar de la Renta"" bathroom amenities are perfect. The SPA and swimming pool are the perfect spot to rest, or maybe you prefer to enjoy a delicious afternoon tea in their lobby.
The breakfast is an experience itself, everything is so good and fresh that you can spend hours there reading your newspaper.
It was really hard to check out, I had high expectations and they went beyond them."
794,Date of stay: August 2016,50,"Extremely, superbly, outstandingly magnificent","This hotel has it all, and down to a tee. The rooms have state of the art domotica, automatic blinds and curtains, an ultra-modern entertainment/tv system, a wonderfully stocked minibar, WIFI, coffee-machine hidden in a cupboard, etc. etc. There is nothing left to wish for. On our floor (24th) each room had its own valet who took care of such matters as laundry, room-service, etc. In the lobby you can start your shopping spree in the Arcade which has great brands. Each morning breakfast at the Verandah was a treat; so many choices, so elegantly presented. I don't think we have ever seen a hotel offer this kind of breakfast in such a superb way; top marks for The Peninsula. Waiters who are quick made our breakfast experience even more enjoyable. We had only two days in Hong Kong and the weather was lousy, but the hotel's excellent Concierge desk arranged for private car tours of Hong Kong that were fun and also gave us a good view of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. On top of all that, the hotel has some great restaurants, such as Spring Moon (Chinese) and Imasa (Japanese). This is one of the very few hotels you could spend a week in and never leave the premises!"
795,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Top of the Top,"One of the best and must go in HKG> Locted in Kawloon, not directly at the water but close buy. Hotel has all RR in the city for trasnport and pickup. Rooms with a good view and diection HK are expensive. Service is TOP. If not staying there go for the Thea in the afternoon."
796,Date of stay: August 2016,50,great hotel,"Was on a guided tour. Tour company picked all hotels, and picked this one. Spectacular. Clean, elegant, safe feeling, quite, centrally located. Hong Kong skyline just outside the hotel. Numerous restaurants in hotel. Did breakfast buffet (varied American and Chinese options, plentiful and beautifully displayed) and b/c of heavy rain one night did dinner buffet. Same comments for that. Quite pool. Helpful and attentive staff. Neat control consoles by beds to control everything. Great spot."
797,Date of stay: August 2016,50,A Grand Hotel with old world charm but also the latest in technology,"The Peninsula is a superb hotel with old world charm but lots of sophistication and luxury.
It was our third and longest stay at the hotel.
We are creatures of habit so it was also the third time we had stayed in the same courtyard room in the old part of the hotel.
We added a touch of additional luxury to our stay by being picked up at the airport and dropped off at the hotel by the Peninsula's trademark green Rolls Royce.
On arrival we were whisked quickly to our room as they did our check-in there.
The room and its bathroom are spacious and very modern. We were able to use the hotel wi-fi to keep in touch with our relatives and friends in Australia.
We had breakfast at the Veranda Restaurant and the service we received from the restaurant manager, Kenneth Ng, was excellent. That he remembers your preferred beverage or juice, adds a charming personal touch.
The hotel was very close to where our Hong Kong tailor is located. This meant a short walk was all that was required. The Peninsula is ideally located in Kowloon. It is not far to the Harbour City shopping mall and the K11 Shopping Mall as well as adjoining Nathan Road.
Our room was kept neat and tidy while we out and about. The faultless room service is something that could be overlooked because it happens so quietly and efficiently.
One of the must do things at the Peninsula is High Tea in the Lobby Restaurant. We had High Tea with some friends in the area reserved for guests of the hotel. We made our reservation before we left for Hong Kong. If you are a guest it is important to take advantage of the reservation system so you can avoid the long queue for those who are not guests and so you can have your afternoon tea at your choice of time.
We had several dinners at the Lobby Restaurant and the service and food was always excellent. The service is such that they ask how you want your beef burger cooked.
The ambience of the Peninsula is greatly enhanced by the magnificent floral displays throughout the hotel."
798,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Old Lady of Hong Kong,"One of the best hotels I've ever stayed at! I mean I don't even know where to start, the hotel takes class and elegance to a whole new level and the history behind it is simply amazing.

The hotel has guests that are now 4th generation of travellers who stay only at the Peninsula when the visit Hong Kong.

The Manager on duty was kind enough to tell me a little about the hotel and some of its guests when she pointed out a man in his early 30's and said he's the 3rd generation who's stayed at this hotel.

The spacious lobby with flawless interiors just mesmerises you with the entrance lined up with signature Green Rolls Royce Phantoms!

I mean it doesn't get better than this! Even if it's just for a night, if you're going to Hong Kong you have to stay at The Peninsula!"
799,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Business stay,"From the moment you arrive you feel like a Vip... It seems like they can anticipate your every move. They nicely make you go through all amenities in the bedroom (and they do have a lot, nail dryer, printer, fax, magical mirror which comes up from a desk when you least expect it...). I must say I was a bit lost with the iPads which controls the lights, tv, curtains, etc but i quite got the hang of it.
My only disappointment was that the in room dining stops at 11pm and when you work long hours, well, the fruit platter doesn't quite do the trick. The morning breakfast buffet was really nice with a gorgeous setting. I loved my stay and it made work much more enjoyable when you know you come home to such a comfortable and beautiful setting. Loved it even if I am not a big city person... Very central to major shopping or trains."
800,Date of stay: August 2016,50,"The ""Grand Dame"" of hotels","If you can afford it, there is no doubt whatsoever that this one needs to be on your bucket list. A unique combination of olde world charm mixed with modern technology and amenities with the best harbour views.

The Peninsula has withstood the test of time and never ceases to amaze and inspire. Surely this is the benchmark in service quality!

Not only are you treated like royalty, your individuality is recognised and everything about this hotel is centred around making you feel like you are the most special guest in attendance.

I can wax lyrical for hours, but with a hotel this special, you really just don't have to say anything more. A perfect 10!!

Overtime we return to the Peninsula Hong Kong it just seems to get better. Make sure to get a Rolls Royce transfer from the airport, it just starts the stay off on the right foot.

The best!"
801,Date of stay: August 2016,50,first leg of a family holiday,"Views over the river were spectacular from the interconnecting bedrooms that were just wonderful. The service was faultless and we were made to feel very welcome. A special hotel indeed. Fantastic pool for the children at the end of the day to swim away the shopping legs!! The only comment I would make is that the family were tired one day and we had the buffet for dinner. Two tired children, a couple of pieces of beef, a yorkshire pudding and ice cream. My wife and I had more , a cheap bottle of wine and then we were presented with the bill. In excess of £500. I live and work in London and can honestly say its the most I have ever spent on a ""cheap"" family dinner!!."
802,Date of stay: December 2015,50,High Tea,We treated ourselves to a high tea at the Penninsula. It's pricey but soooooo worth it. The food was delicious. Make sure you don't wear shorts otherwise you will be turned away unless your staying in the hotel. Anyway it's the place to dress up for & feel very important. Definitely try it & you won't be disappointed.
803,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Overall review of stay.,"The Hotel itself was amazing, however the Afternoon Tea was a cast of hundreds they must empty tour
buses to attend. The Tea itself was rushed, the food mediocre and the crowds waiting in line distracting"
804,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Amazing Hotel,"This was our first trip to Hong Kong and The Peninsula Hotel turned out to be absolutely everything we expected and so much more. The hotel is stunningly beautiful, the service was friendly and attentive, and the view from our room every night, priceless. Make sure and take your swimsuit to take advantage of the pool when you have some down time. We look forward to returning to Hong Kong and it wouldn't be the same experience without staying at The Peninsula."
805,Date of stay: August 2016,50,Pure Class,"Met at the foot steps of the plane by our own electric buggy and porter who whisked us through customs into a waiting hallmark green rolls royce, we made it to the hotel in short shrift.

My wife is a travel journalist and writes about hotels so I tend to get spoiled a bit and as a results I guess you might say I'm not easy to impress.

The Peninsula reminded me of their hotel in Bangkok...a very similar feel exemplified
by the common high standard of training and staff attention. In addition they have really thought through the touchpoints that matter to travellers. I particularly liked the idea of the free VOIP phone which allows for free unlimited calls to anywhere in the world. I actually couldn't quite get it to work myself and the jet lag had me fast asleep
when I might have wanted to phone someone. The food, the service and the ambience were all spectacular."
806,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Anniversary Celebration part 2,"Clearly this is one of the most iconic hotels in Hong Kong so I decided to stay here as well. The hotel lobby is gorgeous and big but a bit crowded and hence the 4.5 stars I started out with but I ended up giving it a 5 stars despite my Kowloon view.
But the room and welcome amenity of tea and later champagne was amazing. And no hotel I've stayed in tops the Peninsula for its in room technology features. I love this hotel, the food service and the amazing afternoon tea."
807,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Great moment,We took the afternoon tea and we really enjoyed the experience but not the price.I recommend for a relaxing break even if the queue is long. We didn't sleep at the hotel but one day for sure as the service is 5 stars.
808,Date of stay: July 2016,20,Overpriced coffee and not so high tea...,"We love visiting the Peninsula tea rooms when in HK, and on this occasion we were booked for a spa/massage which included high tea. We had arrived early in HK, and still had a few hours to kill and ordered some coffee to beat the jet lag. 2 coffees cost $HK165 (or $A14/coffee) which was inappropriate and highly overpriced. The spa session and massage was bar far the most exhilarating (and jet lag busting) experience imaginable and is worthy of a separate review.

Sadly, the high tea was nowhere near as good as it used to be. Apart from the scones, the cakes and sandwiches were not on par with previous visits, which were too sugary, coarsely made and unappealing. London establishments (such as Pont St and The Berkley), offer cutting edge delights at more competitive costs and Peninsulas high tea was simply not in the same league. Disappointed."
809,Date of stay: December 2015,40,Not a room review but an absolutely nice place!,"I was born and grew up in Hong Kong, In 2012, it was the first time I went into the penisula - it was christmas as well.
They had like a ball party and everyone was so happy.
The architecture was elegant and graceful, not like the other hotels in HK. - but the cafe was small and little bit pricey but still worth going though!"
810,Date of stay: June 2016,40,Huge selection of afternoon tea,"My childhood friend treated me to this place for afternoon tea one afternoon in June. They were doing a promotion for Tiffany, and so had all the Tiffany brand desserts on the top of the tray. My friend and myself do not have sweet tooth, so we did not have any of it. My other friend told me as these cakes are made of cream, if not eaten on the spot, do not bring it as takeaway as otherwise will cause us to have an upset tummy.

The trays also have other selections: scorns English style, which used to be one of my favourite; and there were 4 of them. I only had 1 of it, and my friend also had 1. Took the remaining as takeaway, only to realize later on that things that contain cream will go rotten if we leave it in the outside for too long.

There are also finger sandwiches which are to our liking, and we managed to finish everything.

Always have to go early to queue for a place.

Each patron got 2 servings of tea of our choice, which is good."
811,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Gorgeous might be an understament,"It's been a symbol of luxury and elegance ever since erected and led the way in this direction . Today as in the past being a guest here is an event and we should be grateful such a possibility exists . The hi-tech integration made it an example for the new generation hotels while its class shines through . Several touchpads in the room control everything from lightning to curtains to hotel offers to media . Card readers , blueray ,hdmi add everything you could possible and want to see that is if you have time taking your eyes away from the fantastic ,day and night view , of the Victoria harbour . The pool is in a league itself and the breakfast - well , leaves you wanting for nothing more .
A fantastic stay in a fantastic hotel !"
812,Date of stay: July 2016,40,Elegant and pure luxury,"Got greeted at arrival and used the buggy to take us though immigration and custom. Very disappointed that we couldnt get the Rolls Royce transfer as it wasnt available either ways. Excellent checkin done very smoothly in the rooms. The pools also is very nice specially in the evening with the light show. Disappointed with the spring moon restaurant, had to wait very long for the food to arrive and then not all the main course turned up together had to ask three times which is not acceptable for what I was expecting. Great gadgets in the room, every control for TV, room service, lights and curtain are control over a tablet which was really nice."
813,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Formidastic,"Best hotel I have ever stayed at! Excellent attention and service, fantastic swimming pool and great food. Rooms are exquisite. Try a suite for 2 nights in summer and you get a driven mini cooper for 3 hours per day to do your sightseeing and shopping!"
814,Date of stay: May 2016,50,World Class In Every Way,"We have stayed at many Peninsula hotels and this is the best of them all. It is a world class hotel in every way. The rooms are outstanding, the views fantastic, excellent food options, wonderful service, great pool and workout facilities and a world class mall all rolled into one. Let's start with the view. The hotel overlooks Victoria Harbor on the Kowloon side which means you have the best possible views of the iconic skyline and mountains beyond. We were in Room 2407, the Kylin Suite. It is a large corner suite with views in 3 directions. We had a nice entry hall with a powder room, a nicely decorated large living room with a work desk, comfortable couches and chairs, wall entertainment unit and that view. The bedroom had 2 large easy chairs overlooking the harbor with a large telescope. Comfy bed and many pillow options. There is a dressing room with every amenity, including a make up table, nail polish dryer, trays for jewelry etc. There is a large butler container between the dressing room and the outside hall that you can put clothes and shoes into which the butler can take from the hall never needing to come into the room. We used this several times to have shoes polished, and clothes laundered and cleaned. The bathroom is very large with separate his and her sinks separated by a raised corner 2 person tub with dramatic views of the skyline behind the hotel and looking down Victoria Harbor. The best feature of all were the high tech controls. Besides wall units there were 2 ipads which controlled everything in the room (a/c, heat, every light, the tv's, opening the drapes and curtains) and from which you could order room service among many other functions. It was awesome! Oh yeah- the room includes VOIP so you could phone anywhere in the world for free! Aside from the room the hotel has many restaurants to choose from. We particularly enjoyed the Chinese restaurant which had great service, and wonderful fried rice with pineapple and desserts that reminded me of hostess snowballs but 10 times as good. A buffet breakfast was included. The buffet was among the most expansive we have every seen and we travel all over the world. There were many stations with every kind of food, western, asian, vegetarian, etc. and all were fresh and good tasting. The lobby has a large restaurant which serves high tea with live music. Every morning we would work out in the exercise room overlooking the harbor. The machines were modern and well maintained. There is also a lap pool and an outdoor deck to enjoy the views. The hotel also has a high end shopping arcade with many the top stores, such as Chanel, Goyard, Graff, etc. The service was at all times friendly and accommodating. All in all this is a world class hotel in every way."
815,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Absolutely the Best Staff Anywhere,"I stayed at The Peninsula Hong Kong for 9 nights and every day was an example of excellence. After a 15 hour flight from Dallas the staff was at the airport and guided me straight through luggage collection, customs and directly to my awaiting car. Upon arrival, no stop at the front desk was necessary. The staff was on top of my every need.

I travel a lot and know quality when I see it and no hotel can compare to this level of sincere service. The entire hotel is understated elegance, well maintained and very high tech. The room itself was amazing with every luxury anticipated in advance. Culinary quality at the restaurants and room service was akin to the finest restaurants around the globe. Many big hotels can be cold and impersonal but at The Peninsula I felt like I was truly among friends and it had a great home feel to it. The pool was also a great place to relax for an hour or so. Another real treat is a quick sight seeing flight around Hong Kong from the China Clipper lounge on the hotels rooftop.

If you are not lucky enough to stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong I would highly recommend the afternoon tea or a service at the Spa. The spa atmosphere made me forget about anything beyond the waterfall and hot tea.

In short, the entire hotel staff demonstrated true professionalism with flawless execution!"
816,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Always book the Rolls Royce transfer!,"As Virtuoso luxury travel advisor, I frequently visit luxury hotels to ensure the property is excellent and that I can rest assured when booking clients there.

When I was in Hong Kong, the Peninsula was a must stop. Starting off with the Rolls Royce airport transfer. We were met at the gate and quickly escorted through immigration and enroute to the hotel. There's nothing like stepping off of an international flight and receive 5 stars service before even reaching the hotel.

We booked a Superior Suite but was further upgraded to a Deluxe Suite. The suite was fantastic. Being in the original building, I was not expecting great harbour views so we were shocked to see expansive views of the harbour and the skyline.

The in room technology ensured that everything you needed is always within reach.

Overall, it was fantastic stay and I have no hesitation in recommending the Pen to my clients traveling to Hong Kong."
817,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Ultimate in Luxury,"Everything about The Peninsula Hong Kong was top notch. From the pick-up at the airport to the last moment of check-out, we were treated with the utmost of gracious care. The accommodations combine classic elegance with modern amenities. The views were spectacular. Breakfast and tea in the lobby were a special treat. Each member of the staff was extremely helpful and treated us like honored guests. Can't wait to return!"
818,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Excellent Hotel,"The Peninsula Hong Kong works like clock work. Our experience commenced when we were personally collected at the Shun Tak Ferry Terminal and transported to the hotel in one of the iconic Peninsula Rolls Royces. On arrival we were personally received and ushered up to our perfectly appointed room where we were seamlessly checked-in.

The room was large, well designed and had the perfect ambience. The full marble bathroom was equally impressive. The in-room technology was a treat to use (I find many hotels fail to pull this off).

With our room we received complimentary wi-fi, complimentary mini-bar (which did not lack), a range of complimentary films and more. We were also allowed to remain with the room until our Rolls Royce transfer to the airport. Absolutely the greatest convenience when you are facing a long haul international flight back home.

The lobby of the hotel is absolutely stunning. We dined there on two occasions during our stay - the Tiffany & Co New York Afternoon tea and for a quick dinner. The Afternoon Tea was OK. The dinner was great quality for casual dining.

Breakfast buffet was at the Verandah.
Also dined at Verandah for a lunch buffet. It was good but I do not believe it lived up to the reputation.

A very enjoyable stay at a great hotel."
819,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Top stay.,"Excellent accommodation. First class. Classy rooms, excellent comfy beds, all modern gadgets/electronics, big bathrooms, great vews, very luxurious, excellent helpfull staff. Recommended and will stay there again."
820,Date of stay: June 2016,40,Definition of 'Classy Elegance',"Had a very impressive afternoon tea experience here in this historical, classy hotel! Highly appreciate how creative the F&B team has been- despite of being one of the oldest and most traditional historic hotels, they keep making brand crossover and bringing new elements to their already-renowned service/product! This Tiffany themed afternoon tea was one of the most patent examples! And the overall ambiance of the hotel was very nice and has a rich colonial colour in it :)"
821,Date of stay: July 2016,30,Peninsula Hk,"Good location ,good food , and good price $$ you have dress nice ,No sport beach wears ! This hotel during the Second World War is the solder's headquarters for 3 years 8 months ! The value of this hotel is worth 3 bags of rice (300lbs)on that time !"
822,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Wonderful to be back,"We visited this hotel many years ago and despite staying in many top class hotels in other countries, we have never found a better one. We wanted to return and were able to do so in July of this year. It was not a disappointment. We received a lovely welcome at reception and they knew that this was a celebration of our ruby wedding. When we arrived in the room, there was a bottle of champagne and a truly spectacular cake with a fondant red rose decorating it. That was a surprise and a generous gift which we greatly appreciated. We had a lovely room with a view of the harbour. The staff was very attentive and courteous at all times. The food was superb (especially a croque monsieur in the lobby and the meal in the French restaurant).
The attention to detail is outstanding. The flower displays throughout the hotel are breathtaking. We were given a tour of the chocolate room which was a delight.
I don't know if we'll have a return visit to Hong Kong, but if we do, there is nowhere else we would even consider staying."
823,Date of stay: July 2016,50,A dream come true!,"Twenty years ago, I visited Hong Kong for the first time. I was shown to my hotel room and it was very modern and very nice and I thought it was great. Until I opened my curtains and looked through the window and saw the Peninsular. I decided right then that I would one day stay at this glorious hotel and finally I did. The Peninsular had a lot to live up to - I had dreamed of staying there for years. And it absolutely lived up to my (high) expectations. We ordered the Rolls Royce to collect us from the airport and from the time we stepped off the aircraft, the Peninsular staff looked after us as if we were the most important people in the world. Intelligent, caring, proactive staff from the driver, to the reception staff, to the porters to the waiters and barmen. I cannot recommend this hotel more highly if you're after a truly special experience. We'll be back - and damn the expense! In this case, you definitely get what you pay for. The Peking Duck in the Spring Moon restaurant is a must as is a Cosmopolitan from Fan at The Bar. And go for a room overlooking Victoria Harbour - simply superb."
824,Date of stay: September 2015,50,The peninsula,"What should I say ! One of the best stay in town .
The peninsula in on the Kowloon side . For me anyway the best side .
Hongkong is absolute stunning and it has a lot of good hotels , but this one is for me the best one .
Amazing spa, amazing food, amazing Oscar de la renta toiletries :))))

Totally electronic , the light the curtain, everything .

Totally amazing . Have a tee in the lobby."
825,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Verandah / excellent service,"The verandah is on the mezzanine level n some tables have a nice view of the harbor but you need to book early !
The service and people that work in this restaurant are probably the best in HK
They have some young people working there now which is refreshing
Special thanks to sande for his kind service and nice personality !
If you want to eat one of the best buffets in HK n in a classy environment , this is the place
You won't be disappointed !!"
826,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Memorable stay,A special hotel with a great atmosphere and exceptional service! We stayed three nights and enjoyed every aspect of it. The rooms were very comfortable with very up to date facilities. It was a great experience to stay at the Peninsula.
827,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Worth every dollar!,"The Peninsula is not the cheapest place to stay in HK but I would argue up to now it has given us the best value for money we have experienced in the city. There is everything you need (perhaps more) in the room and everything is immaculate. The room was a great size for HK, the bed superb and the bathroom great. Everywhere very clean as well and the Housekeeping staff very efficient.
Our check-in was very efficient but it did take (strangely) longer than usual I felt. Why? Because the Receptionist was so keen to give us a great welcome and to ensure everything was perfect. He made us feel at home straightaway! From Reception to the Concierge Desk to book our airport transfer. What a laugh! The staff were superb and funny and despite the transfer costing 1600HK$ I left the desk feeling I had done the right thing. The Rolls Royce transfer I would highly recommend. From start to finish hassle free! We were only here for 2 nights and we were spending a lot of time with our friends who live in HK so we only had time to have a drink in The Bar and The Lobby and have breakfast. On every occasion the service was first class! On our next visit we will have Afternoon Tea (it looked delicious) and we will use the restaurants. A great stay!"
828,Date of stay: June 2016,50,The way to do Hong Kong,"My husband and me met our dear friends in Hong Kong. The Peninsula hotel was truly the way to experience comfort. Luxury, elegance and impeccable service and food. Don't forget to order the Rolles Royce service to pick you up at the airport to transfer you to the hotel. They literally had someone waiting with a cart to move us quickly through customs, drive us to hotel and escort us straight to our room to avoid front desk checkin . Tea and snacks were set up for us. Live the Peninsula Hong Kong .

829,Date of stay: July 2016,50,"The hotel is world class, but the service makes it a legend","This was my second time stayed at the Peninsula.
It is one of the few hotels with this history; location and reputation, that could maintain consistently the high standards and yet conserves the classic colonial feeling.
From the entrance and designs of the hotel, the iconic lobby and the lift, the guest room and the state-of-the art control system in the guest room; all these are carefully prepared and maintained by the staff.
I strong recommend you to try the indoor swimming pool, it has a panoramic view of the Victoria Harbor, it may be the best pool view in HK or even Asia. It would be a mistake if you went to the pool and didn't try the sauna on the 7/F; it is not huge but well maintained and attended by a team of friendly staff.
There are several famous restaurants inside the peninsula; they are premium and of extremely good quality and services.
My wife and I enjoyed the stay in the Peninsula and will definitely come back again; it is the services, attention to detail mentality makes the hotel a legend. I would recommend the people to try at least once; to experience the legend."
830,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Amazing Service,"While the hotel is elegant and the rooms beautifully appointed, the service at the Peninsula is what really sets it apart. We were met at the gate by representatives of the hotel. They guided us through customs, into a waiting shuttle, and then shepherded us right into our room to check us in. We later discovered that our youngest had left something on the plane, and the concierge staff worked diligently to insure that we had it back in our hands the next morning."
831,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Christmas day evening meal,The food was excellent as was the service - we were right in front of the stage and the band were great - we even had a dance with them later on in the evening! The views were spectacular and we enjoyed the entire evening - would recommend The Felix and hope to eat there again
832,Date of stay: July 2016,50,The best breakfast buffet!,"We truly enjoyed our stay at this remarkable hotel. The staff provided an amazing level of service and we were pleased with the great amenities and perks like free on- demand movies and VOIP. The rooms are about half the size as those in the Penisu,a Shanghai, but are still fairly spacious.

The breakfast buffet was the best we had throughout our entire tour through China. There was a good balance between eastern and western options and the service staff was attentive and plentiful.

We throughout enjoyed our stay here and would gladly stay here again on our next visit."
833,Date of stay: June 2016,50,"Great hotel, wonderful service","We decided on a few days of luxury on our way home at the end of a month travelling in Europe. We booked a room in the old building, which we remember admiring very much from as far back as our first visit to Hong Kong in 1990, and were not disappointed.

The room we booked was sold as having Kowloon views, so we were delighted at check-in to be told that we had been upgraded to a harbour view room, and that the room was ready some 4 hours before normal check-in. The receptionist took us to our spacious room and demonstrated all the technology, where just about everything is controlled from an iPad. And soon after we were delivered traditional chinese tea as a welcome refreshment. We were then about to head out for an excursion when housekeeping arrived to see if we needed fresh towels. This is the level of service you soon find is part and parcel of staying at this grand hotel.

We found the housekeeping staff were absolutely wonderful, always looking for something that they could do to make us more comfortable. And throughout the hotel, from the front doors to the breakfast buffet the staff are looking to anticipate your needs. Naturally this level of service comes at a cost, but any time you feel the need for a little pampering you won't find many better places to receive it than the Peninsula, Hong Kong."
834,Date of stay: August 2015,50,One of my all time favorite,"Peninsula Hong Kong is always one of my all time favorite! First came here back in 2007, they welcome us with a plate full of fruit in the room. We love the bathroom, roomy make-up area and best, professional service ever! Haven't had a chance to try the afternoon tea yet, will always stay here when we visit Hong Kong."
835,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Pamper yourself and stay here!,"Arrival - meet and greet staff was at the gate; accompanied to customs and after immigration check was transferred to driver who took over the luggage to the awaiting Rolls Royce (see photos). Lovely emerald colour RR reminded me of the wizard of oz and the emerald city! Smooth and comfortable drive into the city. Complimentary Evian water was provided on the RR - great for flight dehydration.
Check-in was a breeze. Was shown by check-in staff to the room and introduced to the room controls.
Room was spacious with calming and natural colours. High ceilings. Luxurious marbled bathroom with similar emerald green theme as the RR. Separate toilet and standing shower and large bathtub. Two vanity tops on opposite sides. Bed was super comfy. A separate hallway leading to the bathroom with the wardrobe on one side - a walk-in wardrobe in a sense. Free calls in HK and also internationally. free wifi provided was reliable.
Afternoon tea at the Lobby - The hotel Lobby is famous for the afternoon tea, with long queues to get a table. Made arrangements prior to arrival for afternoon tea right after checking in. Reservations only for guests staying at the Peninsula Hotel. Non-hotel guests have to join the queue.
Wonderful high ceiling in the lobby and entrance with marbled decor reminiscent of the grand colonial days. A live music performance above the lobby while you enjoy the delightful tea set.
Location - right at the edge of TST. Walking distance to the habour city shops and also the ferry terminal to Hong Kong Island side. MTR station conveniently located right by hotel.
Breakfast - room had breakfast included. Buffet breakfast on the second floor was pretty crowded at peak times with guests waiting for a table - be prepared to wait 15 minutes for a table so go early if you are rushing for a meeting. You can opt for the quieter lobby breakfast set on the first floor. Hostesses tried their best to arrange for tables. Tables on the inside of the restaurant had good lighting by the windows while those in the separate lobby area nearer the lifts were more dimly lit. Good quality spread, especially liked the onsen eggs. Though there was variety, it got a bit boring after the third day. Did not have an opportunity to dine at the other restaurants. They had other packages with dining available which you can take advantage of for that special occasion.
Pool, spa and gym - were clean and well maintained. Enjoyed the large indoor pool. Deco was venetian themed. Spa with hot tub jacuzzi was relaxing after a long day of sight-seeing and shopping.
Staff were friendly and approachable.
Stay here and pamper yourself in this luxurious hotel in HK!"
836,Date of stay: July 2016,50,"Service Extraordiaire , Nothing Beats this","I have just arrived for my 3rd visit to Hong Kong and I am back at the worlds most luxurious and classy hotels... The Peninsula Hong Kong!!!! This is simply the best place on the entire planet. I reserved one of the Phantom Rolls Royce cars to pick me up at the airport and it's such a treat after a long flight. The staff at the airport meets you at the gate and escorted me to the customs area. Then helps you to the baggage claim and to the car waiting outside. It's a beauty.
The welcome at the hotel which I received was a special welcome. The head of guest relations (Alice Chan) is such an amazing asset to the Peninsula that words do not even describe her. She and I have communicated about a couple of my trips and she knew I was coming in on her day off but still came to greet me as I arrived at the hotel entrance. I was so grateful and wanted to acknowledge this unbelievable service given here. It doesn't stop with Alice chan, all of her colleagues and all of the hotel staff go above and beyond the call of duty to make you feel welcome and comfortable.
This hotel is by far one of the most beautiful and wonderful in every way. I will only stay here when travelling to Hong Kong. It's simply amazing. Make sure to stay here"
837,Date of stay: October 2015,50,The Peninsula Hong Ko,We made reservations for the Peninsula from New York. We were picked up at the airport by the driver of the hotel in a Rolls Royce. The staff were all very professional and they responded to your every need. The rooms were spacious and very comfortable. We even had a TV in the bathtub. At night the curtains would close via pushing a button and there were a stream of lights on the floor setting a path to the bathroom. We had dinner at Gatties ( not sure of the spelling) which was extremely expensive but the food was very good. The service was impeccable. WE also enjoyed high tea at 4:00 PM WHICH WAS A TREAT. The biggest disappointment was that my father-in-law ordered Monte Cristo cigars made in Cuba and when they arrived in the states he received Monte Cristo cigars that were made in the Phillipines. We had American Express act in our behalf and after 2 Tries we got our money back. The view of the Kalloon Harbor was outstanding and worth the high price of the room.
838,Date of stay: July 2016,50,Best service by far,"5+. Quite simply the best service I have experienced in Asia ( no eye rolls, no feeling like they were going out of their way or beyond the call of duty. Nothing but genuine friendly professionalism). We did a family staycation and admittedly we are a bit high maintenance with a few young kids. But the Peninsula lived up to its reputation with grace and dignity. Shout out to the breakfast staff for helping with the kids, housekeeping for the extra diaper toxic cleaning, room service for the extra kid food heat ups (and quick glass of wine). Next time when we are not carrying icecream cones everywhere I will try the Rolls."
839,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Perfect hotel,"This was my second time at this beautiful hotel , it's at a great location with most of the shops and brands around you , the Victoria bay is just Infront of you , the best coffee shop is in the lobby . And the rooms are my favorite , tech rooms with tv in bathroom and one place control of room and also you have phone voip which means you can make overseas free calls . The view is great on the bay skyline and you can see the other side of the island . Will surely come back again"
840,Date of stay: May 2016,50,"Amazing Staff, Best of the Best Hotel","I stayed here on May 2016, I had doubts when I considered the Peninsula Hong Kong as I did not feel it looked good on its website. It looked rather dated so on my previous trips to Hong Kong, I tended to stay in either the W or The Intercontinental. I finally tried Peninsula Hong Kong and from the moment I was met at the airport by the hotel staff to the time I departed, the service was exceptional and my overall stay, as close to perfection as it could be.

I found the rooms to be spacious and well appointed, classic in design with some teak flooring and furniture throughout. We really enjoy the amazing harbor view. the location itself was convenience. We did the Rolls Royce pick up which was nice.

Staff were amazing, professional and well trained ! sure thing I will be back for my family trip with my kid very soon .."
841,Date of stay: April 2016,50,The best of the best,I don't need to say much so I'll keep this short but sweet. The Peninsula is by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I don't think I'll ever stay in another hotel like it.The room was the most luxurious room I've ever stayed in. It made me feel like royalty.
842,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Excellent Hotel Stay,I recently took my family here for a 4 day vacation in HK. We did the Rolls Royce pick up which was nice. I had the harbor view deluxe room which was fantastic. There rooms were well appointed and had a 3 tablets which controlled everything. Every little detail in the room was well thought out. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
843,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Outstanding Property,"We recently visited Hong Kong and stayed at the Peninsula. From meeting us at the airport to dropping us off at the airport at the end of our visit, the service was outstanding. The hotel is beautiful, the rooms are large, beautifully appointed and equipped with amenities to make are stay as comfortable as possible.

We travelled with our eight month old Grandson and the hotel provided all things necessary to easily care for him.

There were so many things about the hotel that were special but the breakfast buffet stands out as the one thing we all agreed on. Excellent.

We definitely would go back!"
844,Date of stay: June 2016,20,Not worth it,"I don't normally frequent luxury hotels so maybe I shouldn't have gone there but I treated myself to a drink in the rooftop bar Felix while watching the harbour lights. Very expensive glass of wine ($130 HK), unremarkable, the windows have blinds so wouldn't do it again."
845,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Awesome Hotel dan the view directly to the harbour,"i was here for short trip and i love this hotel very much especially right in the central which is very close to everywhere like shopping mall, restaurant and night club, especially the hotel have a facilities a branded store and very popular with the hightea, the room is so luxury and have good facilities like gym, spa, swimming pool, restaurant etc"
846,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Best hotel in Hong Kong.,"We had a room in the new tower, 12th floor, Kowloon view, facing North. The hotel has been recently renovated and it is great. Very nice bed, turndown etc. and room steward always available. The breakfast buffet was thew best ever, with plentiful Western and Eastern foods to choose. Great service there as well. The pool and spa are world class for a city hotel. Concierge speak several languages, no issues, good guidance. A worthwhile luxury splurge for maybe a once in a lifetime trip. Would gladly return, time and funds permitting."
847,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Beyond expectations,"Usually people only write a review when there is a problem. I want to write a review to let you know how great this hotel is. That the rooms and suites are beautiful everybody knows. But the service is really cherry on the cake, don't know if you say it like this in English but it means that it's more than great. I arrived, after a long trip with a jet lag at 7 am. Not only that the room was already ready, this is already a great service, but in the room there was a breakfast for me. To welcome me. Need I say more? This is really more than excellent and this is what's making the Peninsula Hongkong the best hotel worldwide. We travel all over the world, so I can compare, but the Peninsula is really the best!!!"
848,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Excellent stay at the Peninsula HK,"We went for a family vacation June 12-16. When we arrived we checked into our rooms on the fifth floor, had breakfast and set off on a tour. When we came back to the hotel around 3, we went back to our rooms. Unfortunately, they are doing construction on the hotel from 9-5. The jack hammering was so loud, that we asked to move rooms. Nick at the front desk graciously moved our rooms, so we no longer heard the construction. We moved to the 27th floor. We had many meals at the Veranda. Loui was amazing and helped us navigate the buffet. Both children have Celiac disease. The chef walked us through the entire buffet to tell us what was safe to eat. He even made gluten free pasta for the kids and an amazing gluten free dessert. My kids enjoyed the pool. It's a beautiful hotel with amazing customer service. I would highly recommend this hotel if you will be traveling to Hong Kong."
849,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Just One Thing,"Overall this hotel was amazing. They are very good at gluten free as for breakfast they had a gluten free cereal, special ""roasted potatoes"" that were gluten free just for me and my family, and for dinner, they made us a special gluten free dessert. The one problem was at my room, there was loud construction going on, so we had to move rooms. But overall, there are great views, excellent food, and I can get over the construction. Very excellent hotel!"
850,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Fantastic service,"The people working at this hotel were very helpful. Service is over the top.

My family is gluten free and the wait staff and the chefs went out of their way at every meal to make sure that we had gluten free options. After dinner one night he chef sent a wonderful gluten free dessert up to our room! It was a wonderful surprise.

There was a problem with our room, but the front desk staff worked hard to find us a better solution.

The problem with the room: there was construction going on right outside our window. The construction was only happening from 9-5, hours tourists typically wouldn't be in their rooms, but with the jet lag we were keeping odd hours. It was way too loud. They probably shouldn't rent that room until construction is complete. But as noted above, they made amends, found us a better room and comped our transportation to the airport."
851,Date of stay: June 2016,50,What a magnificent experience!,"After flying from Zurich through Dubai to Hong Kong our family was met in arrival by representatives of this hotel, luggage was collected and we were dispatched via the Peninsula signature car service to the hotel. Upon arrival we were taken to our rooms and checked in without any fuss! Dinner at the Chinese restaurant on the first floor was a culinary delight. If you want an experience of tradition, elegance and exemplary service, you must stay at the Peninsula with the best views of Hong Kong harbor."
852,Date of stay: June 2016,10,Horrible drinks stupidly rcpendive,"Went to the Felix bar to tick off from the HK bucket list ""the views and the loos""! Firstly, what a maze the hotel lobby is. Took us 15 mins to find the right lift to get to the bar.

Then when we arrived, hostess was totally over accommodating. Expected to walk in and have my mind blown but the bar is tired, dead with no customers (midnight on a Holiday Saturday night) and NO atmosphere.

When in a situation like this you hope that the drinks make up for the mediocrity but sadly not. I ordered a lychee Mojito and it came (with the four other drinks) after 20 minutes and was BLAND. Supposed to come with lemon lychee and mint but no mint and tasted like a soda water (for $170 very disappointing).

Weirdly, the bar's selling point - of which decor, drinks, music, atmosphere and staff are not - was obstructed by horrendous floor to ceiling to Venetian blinds. When asked to raise these to see the harbour we were told ""no sorry, it's part of the design"". HOW RIDICULOUS.

Don't go here - so mediocre and such a waste of time and money."
853,Date of stay: May 2016,50,fantastic place to be,"i decided to stay in this hotel because i had a business meeting in HK.I travel a lot but this place exceeded my expactation. great service, awesome rooms- very convenient! For now on, each time i travel to HK , i will stay in this Hotel!!!"
854,Date of stay: June 2016,50,Considered one of the best hotels in the world for a reason,"If you book Rolls Royce pick up and drop off to and from the airport there is an Airport VIP personnel waiting for you as you leave your plane and whisk you to immigration on a private transporter, while you are going through immigration they are collecting your bags.After Immigration you are met by Peninsula host and taken to the Limousine Lounge where your car awaits. As you approach the hotel your personal concierge is waiting outside the door and check in is done in your room. Even though it is a grand hotel the rooms could not be more modern. Lights, tv, curtains, menus anything you need are accessed by computer tablets throughout the room.Granted nothing here is cheap, but, if you want to spoil yourself this is the place.The staff are very friendly, professional and waiting to help with anything you need."
855,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Exceeded our expectations from the moment we landed in Hong Kong,"From the minute we stepped out of the plane and had our driver waiting for us, to the private in-suite check in, to the magnificent views of Hong Kong harbor from our suite; the splendor of the lobby, the fabulous restaurants, and the impeccable service and attention to detail made of our stay at this ideally located Hong Kong landmark one of the world's most unique and pleasurable experiences. Having arrived directly from stays at Dubai's Burj al-Arab and Paris' George V, exceeding our expectations was not easy, but the Peninsula truly showed us why it often tops as the world's best hotel."
856,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Old fashioned elegance with modern amenities,"Decided to stay at The Pen to attend a friend's wedding weekend. Opted for the Rolls Royce airport pick-up...well worth every penny as we were greeted by a staff member who whizzed us straight through immigration bypassing queues. Check in was in the room itself, very easy. The room was minimally furnished but elegant & with all mod-cons & it was quiet. Particularly liked the i pad which controlled everything in the room with ease. The staff were attentive & couldn't do enough to help. Old fashioned customer service goes a long way. I know the hotel is renown for its high tea & the daily queues became a little annoying as we had to struggle passed them to get to the lift (ok it's a 1st world problem). The front of house staff (concierge) could have been a little more attentive & we had to wait for taxis which had to be flagged down off the street. For a high end hotel we thought this a little odd. However it is a lovely hotel & would not hesitate to stay here again. Well done."
857,Date of stay: May 2016,50,wow!,"Had a two night stopover in Hong Kong after a long flight. I had a lot of luggage so had opted for the Rolls Royce Collection from the airport which was a fantastic option as it turned out. There was someone to meet me at the airbridge, they escorted me to one of the airport carts and we were whisked off the many miles of corridors to immigration where my escort took care of all the immigration formalities. They escorted me right through to the collection of bags and then introduced me to the driver who took over and accompanied me through the limousine lounge to the waiting car.
The extra it cost for the service more than compensated me for not having to worry about a thing and it enoucraged me to take the same service back to the airport at the end of the stay.
The hotel itself was magnificent and as I am not a fan of Hong Kong I spent a lot of time int he hotel and availed myself of most of its services. The spa and the poo are stunning, and the hotels and bars well placed in the market.
I was upgraded to a room at the front of the old building above the entrance way and had a fabulous view out over the harbour. The room itself was stunning.

Breakfast was well worth the extra,

The concierge was very helpful over a couple of small matters and very knowledgeable as you would expect.

I had a great stay here and although I dont expect to go back, I would aim to return to the hotel if i did."
858,Date of stay: September 2015,40,"""In the lap of luxury at The Peninsula Hong Kong""","The Peninsula Hong Kong is an iconic hotel, majestic in its appeal, with magnificent views overlooking Victoria Harbour. It is so well-maintained, you wouldn't think it was built in 1928!
The opulence, combined with impeccable service we experienced, was the hallmark of this 'Grand Dame of the Far East'.
It's an ideal location with culinary delights, designer shopping outlets (and more), accommodation comforts and sightseeing venues close at hand."
859,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Fabulous food and great service,"I came to the lounge downstairs to have lunch and was not disappointed. Served by very experienced waiters and beautiful surroundings.
the quality of the food was excellent, the price was somewhat high."
860,Date of stay: May 2016,50,an amazing stay,"we stayed at the peninsula hotel in hong kong. it was fantastic. the rooms are lovely...a nice size...the bathrooms are fantastic....the whole 'iPad' thing is really convenient. the area the hotel is in is very convenient also. i asked them to pick us up at the airport and that was fantastic! they actually met us at the gate, led us through the airport, we got to go through a fast customs line, then they found our luggage and to it to the car...when we left, they did the reverse...took our luggage and made sure we were checked in before they left...it was well worth the price! we really enjoyed our stay here...the staff are very nice, friendly...and very helpful..."
861,Date of stay: June 2015,50,The classic standard of luxury,"I've stayed in many a 5 star property, but none of them have come close to the Peninsula when every factor is weighed in. From the amazing staff to the high tech rooms, every bit of our stay was superb. We didn't have a suite and had a limited view from our window, but that mattered so little I never even thought about it. I'm not even going to start in on the red box soap, but I treasured that bar forever after I got home. We dressed up and took high tea in the lobby, of course the hotel moved us to a table immediately where we had views of the entire crowd. It was the most leisurely and interesting moment of my entire stay in HK. My lady is a very savvy shopper, and I've NEVER seen her buy anything in a hotel shop, but she was taken by a piece of Jade and purchased it after some very interesting negotiating. I'm not rich but I'm lucky enough to stay in the best hotels several times a year. None of them have ever come close to the class and standards of The Peninsula. Running into the GM in the elevator and getting a private tour of the museum...just icing on our douhua."
862,Date of stay: May 2016,30,Not like it used to be,"Visited for lunch and realized that the beautiful hotel now lacks service & class . Front door staff looked bored and non professional - The meal was average , the champagne expensive for a taste rather than a measure - disappointing times Peninsula"
863,Date of stay: May 2016,50,NEVER TREATED BETTER!,"As a young enlisted Sailor visiting Hong Kong I used to walk through the lobby and look at splendor that I had only seen in old Hollywood movies and dream of what it would be like to stay there. The years passed by and I decided to take my wife there for our anniversary and it EXCEEDED my expectations.
Met at the jet way and taken by cart by a Peninsula employee all the way to Immigration and then on to Baggage where every detail is handled as you are escorted to your waiting Rolls Royce; everyone at the airport treated us like visiting dignitaries. Whisked away through the busy roads, we did not mind the traffic jam as the driver was eloquent and insightful. Arriving at the door of the hotel is one of those ""I have arrived moments."" Luggage swept away and greeted by Martin from France and escorted to our room.
The room was very well appointed and the bed was the most comfortable hotel sleep experience I have ever had.
The hotel restaurants were wonderful and even at the buffet you were treated with a level of respect and kindness that brings you back to another time. The staff is definitely the strongest point in this hotel, they love their jobs and they are almost like a family.
The Fitness Center, Pool and Spa area were immaculate and luxurious and again the staff was there to tend to your every need. We enjoyed it so much that I actually LOST weight during my stay despite my over indulgence in fine food and drink. Can you imagine eating wonderful cuisine and drinking and coming home and seeing the scale drop?
I have been to Hong Kong many times but this is the first time that I did NOT want to leave the Hotel and run around all day; it was just that good.
If you have an eye for detail you will see that nothing is overlooked. Even leaving Hong Kong, the last thing I saw going into Security was Patrick from the Peninsula waving good bye.
WARNING! Do not stay at this hotel unless you are prepared to be disappointed when you stay elsewhere."
864,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Beautiful and special,"We loved staying here and had a really special visit in Hong Kong at this classic, historic property. I am a big fan of Peninsulas in general and it was fun to stay in the original! Gorgeous lobby, gorgeous room, great service and food. If you are spending most of your time on Hong Kong island, it is not too bad taking the ferry or uber back to Kowloon :) We didn't have a big problem with it and would definitely stay here again."
865,Date of stay: May 2016,50,It does not get any better!,"This is our second stay at this iconic, lovely, exciting, well-located hotel. We are checking out this morning and are SO SAD. Everything here is done well - the best. We can't think of anything to change or upgrade - the architecture, service, rooms, food, tea, location, etc are superlative. Hong Kong is wonderful, but you need to book an extra day here just to spend a full day in the hotel. It is actually a hotel that can determine where you travel - if you are in this area of Asia, think of a reason to be here. The harbor view rooms are worth every minute of looking out at this lovely harbor (only SF and Sydney are in the same class), worth every minute of the reading chair or game table by the window, and every minute in the luxury linens and bath amenities. The pool is relaxing, and you can actually swim laps - then dine, read a book, and enjoy the view from there also. Great spa, also.
The restaurants are superior, the bar cozy, the verandah breakfast the best. Tea in the lobby is a must with your friends and family. (Only hoping the restaurant on the top floor is changed - it is not in sync with this exceptional hotel - cold and vacuous in a space that could be the talk of the town and has stunning views.)
A piece of heaven... thank you!"
866,Date of stay: March 2016,50,hide away in a hectic city,"It situates just minutes from the harbor and sleepless Nathan.
I am not fond of hectic city, shopping nor crowd. I feel comfortable staying at Peninsula Hotel. The room is surprisingly quiet and fully equipped with gadget, amenities, fax machine, coffee brewing machine, good collection of wine and snack.

The room is well decorated, bed and pillows are high end quality. It is a perfect hide away.

Light and sound are controlled at your finger tip by the bed.

The spa and gym is a must to relax after a long busy day. The staff are very knowledgeable and caring."
867,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Splendid High Tea Experience,"While waiting in a queue, eager to experience this afternoon treat, one can soak in the splendour of the opulent Grand Lobby of the Peninsula.
Sipping champagne one listened to the sounds from the Instrumental Trio seated in the Gallery above.
Then tea and trio layered treats were brought to our table by attentive staff.
How delightful!
Savoury treats were four fold.
Scones were accompanied by strawberry jam and cream. On this plate also was a surprise: crisp, caramellised coated egg pastry (I think choux!). It was mouth watering .
Final layer were four bite sized petit fours to the afternoon of sweet and savoury morsels.
A truly worthwhile afternoon of eating."
868,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Old Glory,"I am sure there are now more luxurious hotels in HKG, but the Peninsula has that old time glory that can’t be found in others. Due to some onsite and surrounding construction works hotel access is a bit limited.
Rooms are great and harbor view is a must have at any price.
Breakfast is first class. Couldn’t ask for anything more on choices.
Service is immaculate and the RR airport pickup and drop off is a pleasure."
869,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Fleet of Rolls Royce !!!,Although I didn't stay at this place but visited their restaurant to have a cup of coffee. Got a chance to experience their suite rooms and all the amenities that they provide. Its one of the finest properties of all time and a landmark hotel in global list due to various feathers in their cap.
870,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Iconic Stay!,My husband and I loved every moment of our stay at The Peninsula. We were picked up in the Rolls Royce Phantom...we had someone awaiting us when we got off the plane and were whisked away! The attention to detail was second to none. Everything in the room is controlled by tablet and very easy. Highly recommend the harbor view - phenomenal view and you can even watch the laser light show right from your room! Get a high floor! Service was impeccable throughout the stay. A phenomenal experience all around! Have the Rolls take you back to the airport too and feel like royalty!
871,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Anniversary Present 17/05/2016,From the moment I stepped of the plane I felt spoilt with a Rolls Royce pick up. We cleared immigration and baggage collection with such ease. The Peninsula is really breath taking we were directly taken to our room on the 18th floor where we completed our check in. A lovley surprise awaited us with champagne and lovley little treats aswell as an upgrade to our room. We stayed for 3 nights I could not fault this hotel at all. All the staff smiled and said hello as they passed you. We had breakfast at the verandha which had ample but very delicious varieties. I would definitely come and stay at this hotel again as it is conveniently located and made sightseeing that much more easier.
872,Date of stay: May 2016,40,It's not the Mandarin,"Difficult to rate, as it is a very good hotel, with iconic reputation, so expectations were very high. So ultimately it was a bit of a let down. The reason was not that the hotel was not good, it certainly was comfortable, with well equipped rooms, but it has one major flaw and that is its competitor from just across the harbour, being the Mandarin. Better rooms, service, style and location. Stay at the Peninsular and you won't be disappointed, unless you have had the pleasure of experiencing the Mandarin first."
873,Date of stay: June 2015,50,The view is yours.....,"If you're thinking of staying at the tip of Tsim Tsa Tsai looking for colonial style architecture and you wanna be closer to harbor view...this is the place...you don't wanna walk...fascinated by the view and wanna have your breakfast by the window...oh yes the whole harbor view is yours. The excellent service here is known by the fact that some of famed patrons from the Noble House or some of the related to The Kadoorie's family,the founder of this great historian plaza....once was HQ used by the Japanese when the British surrendered during the WW2 and was reclaimed back and renamed to it's glory...The Peninsula . Never once we doubt about it's excellent service..to say less...it's granted six star awards.
The easiest way to it's way to Peninsula is through the long Nathan Rd if you don't know where Salisbury Rd is...and do not miss the afternoon tea...absolute fabulous!!"
874,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Great Hotel,Hire the golf cart to pick you up right when you get off the airplane. You won't have to think about anything or walk after a long flight. Then have the Rolls car service take you to the hotel. Amazing hotel. Visit Candy at the spa for an amazing facial treatment. Go early and visit the relaxation room for amazing views.
875,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Reliable top quality,"Best hotel in HKG as far as I know. Excellent sense of detail which takes stress out of continuous red eye travelling.
Felix restaurant on top floor has the best view of Hong Kong Island - one of the best bucket list views in the world.
Great fitness area and yoga terrace."
876,Date of stay: May 2016,50,World class hotel,We stayed in a harbour view room for 4 nights. The room was exceptionally comfortable. The room design had been carefully thought through eg the hairdryer was plugged in next to a mirror!!! Something a lot of other 5* establishments don't think about. My husband really enjoyed the variety of food available at breakfast. The staff were very pleasant. The hotel was clean and smart. It's location was superb for all of Hong Kong's attraction. We will use this hotel again if we are back in Hong Kong
877,Date of stay: May 2016,30,An old Lady Wartung for a New Kiss to get up to Glamour !,"I stayed there One Night in May on my was Home from Sailing in The Philippines. I Booker a Double Room including breakfast for two. I got a Double Upgrade to The 19th floor. This made a nice view. The bathroom was probably 20 years old, The Room 15 or more. The Sofa in The room had stains on it. The fruits delivered to The room were prepared without emotions and Style. The breakfast was ok, but just ok. The whole "" Hotel"" missed any Passion. Just not worth The Money."
878,Date of stay: June 2015,50,"Peninsula Quality, Hong Kong Experience!","The Peninsula Hong Kong is such a long heard name not only as a hotel, but a must-visit attraction in Hong Kong. I'm glad my experience staying (and eating here) meet my expectation: perfect location with perfect marina/mountain view; impeccable service as always... And its overall room decoration brings me back to the old Hong Kong of last century. Such a historic luxury hotel to stay in! Can't miss it if traveling to Hong Kong."
879,Date of stay: April 2016,50,HOME AT LAST!!!!! BRILLIANT,"Arrived exhausted, tired and fatigued ....
left a nu nu person,
ten out of ten...
superlatives not necessary as the place is god's heaven
put this place on your bucket list and save up for a ticket to bliss
book Kowloon view and pull back the curtains and enjoy..
worth every honk kong dollar spent.."
880,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Wow experience,"It is one of my best experience i ever had in an hotel, environment is incredibly the only i wasnt so happy is the size of the room it is small for this kind of hotel. Attention is great very clean and great location for a good hong kong experience!"
881,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Enjoy luxury with the best view in Hong Kong,"I stayed at the Peninsula for around 10 days in March 2016 and it was probably the most memorable hotel stay for me. Fortunately, I chose the Victoria Harbor view room which is highly recommended as the Kowloon view room although cheaper would reduce the experience ten fold in my opinion. Peninsula probably has the best harbor view in the city from the harbor view rooms, gym and swimming pool. The rooms are mix of modern and classic finish but really technically advanced with 3 tablets provided to control everything in the room.

The evening tea is highly recommended and there is a long wait for it always, but not if you are staying at the hotel. Rolls Royce car service and helicopter service (ofcourse paid) are really awesome and ultimate luxury experience!

Would love to stay here again if I get a chance."
882,Date of stay: March 2016,40,Disapointed as first time stay and heard so much about it,Efficient pick up from the shipping terminal. Staff efficient but seemed to lack warmth on occasions. Bedrooms rather like a hidden maze but when understood very efficient..Good transport connections for ferry and transit systems.Entrance lobby rather like a railway station concourse with people coming and going and then queueing for afternoon tea. Not a restful place.
883,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Clipper Lounge at the Peninsula Hotel,"A little known part of the Peninsula Hotel is the Clipper Lounge on the 27th floor. It is currently the gathering spot for helicopter flights around Hong Kong..but has a fanastic collection of memorabilia regarding the famous Clipper Ships of the 30's 40's which used the Peninsula as their Hong Kong base.

This is not a bar but a pictorial history lounge

Little known pictures and history of the great seaplanes will take you hours to read and enjoy..

A must see for aviation enthusiasts."
884,Date of stay: May 2016,50,Perfection!,"I must say that I had big expectations and that I was not deceived at all! What a great stay! Everything was beyond perfect since we arrived in Hong Kong and were welcomed by an airport representative who ecorted us until the immigration counter and provided assistance with baggage claim. At this point a Peninsula staff member accompanied us to the Roll's Royce who was waiting for us. After 45 minutes ride we were in our room: spacious, clean and with all amenities you need. As we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, we got a complementary chocolate platter with a Champagne bottle, what a nice surprise!
Breakfast was delicious!
We enjoyed both the gym and the swimming pool where you can benefit of a nice view on adiacent buildings.
I definitively recommend this hotel and I will come back!"
885,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Best suite ever !,"We've been to Hong Kong for the first time . We chose The Peninsula HK ! What can I say : It is a symbol in Hong Kong and I can understand why . This Hotel inspires ellegance and tradition. Everything is exactly what to expect from this kind of a hotel . Well .... there is something that blowed my mind : the suite !
First of all : everything inside was NEW !
Even the carpet had the specific smell of a new carpet .
Second : the gadgets inside the suite ! Everything was like Intelligent Home . Lots of touch controls for the lights , fir the drapes , for AC ....
Third : The furniture ! The furniture is absolutely fantastic . Black laquered wood , massive in all the good ways .

The Hotel and the Staff - PERFECT !

The only thing I didn't like too much - the Lobby ( which by the way is amazing in regards with the design and architecture ) is too busy ! Too many tourists taking pictures or waiting for a table for the afternoon tea .

Conclusion : this is a trully 5* + hotel !"
886,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Amazing. Service takes you back in time!,"Stayed three nights mid April. Service was impeccable. Had view of harbor and it was wonderful. Entire wall is a window.
Breakfast each morning was a feast. The crossants were warm. the bacon crisp and the tea-as you would expect excellent. My husband said the coffee was very good. The options for breakfast were unlimited.
Spent one night in bar. The gin and tonics were well worth the effort. Ended up eating there-way to tired to carry on any further that night.
Pool looked great but alas to tired to care when we returned from touring.
Would like to go back and just enjoy the hotel!!!"
887,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Classy hotel with deep historical roots,"I stayed here for 2 nights during end April. This hotel was very well-located, smacked right beside the Tsim Sha Tsui station. Upon entering, I was awed by the elaborate chandeliers in the lobby, the beautiful frescoes, the warm smiles from the door men and the bell boy, and the polite greetings from the receptionist.

A box of nice chocolate awaited me when I entered the tastefully decorated room. It was one of the best equipped rooms I had stayed in. There was a portable ""ipad""-like device that could operate the TV, lights and curtains. The best of all - a bottle of Evian water would be given every evening!

Highlight of the stay would be the indoor pool in the hotel. It was a beautifully sculpted pool where you can soaked in and relaxed well at the end of a hectic day.

Definitely one of the best hotels I have stayed."
888,Date of stay: January 2016,50,High five for hainanese chicken!,Had a 13 hour stopover in Hong Kong on my way to New York. After a quick excursion to Macau I was famished. I had the absolute pleasure of trying the tastiest hainanese chicken I've ever had!! The service was amazing. The staff were particular about attention to detail. It was pure class and luxury.
889,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Bucket List HOTEL~,"If you are blessed to travel to Hong Kong a must stay is the Peninsula! We were absolutely in awe from when they picked us up at the airport in one of their Rolls Royce Phantoms all the way through our check out day. We were greeted at the United gate and taken through security to gather our bags via golf cart. We were then escorted to our vehicle. Upon arriving at the hotel we were greeted at the door by an employee who escorted us up to our room for check in....mind you we only booked the standard room type. The electronic controls in our room were unbelievable from the ipads on each night stand that controlled the temperature, blinds, phones, lights, etc. to the button that raised the makeup mirror at the desk. A true experience that we will never forget. Every employee that we encountered was over the top cordial and helpful. The pool was something everyone should also see and the view was one that kept us in the pool area for several hours. The location is also great and easy to get anywhere in Hong Kong whether by cab, subway, ferry, or by foot. The breakfast buffet is something that is a must do also....just imagine anything you'd ever want for breakfast, and they had it. The presentations were also unbelievable."
890,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Grand Old Dame is THE place.,"""In the old days"", when people dressed up to travel, the name of any important city throughout the world evoked the name of the ONE hotel where ""everyone"" stayed. Pre-war US examples would include the Plaza in NYC, the Biltmore in LA, the Fairmont in San Fran, Palmer House in Chicago. Royal Hawaiian in Honolulu, etc. This game no longer works in the US, but still holds in some international cities: the Oriental, in Bangkok, the Sacher in Vienna, The Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich, the Ciragan Palace in Istanbul, the Copacabana Palace in Rio the Alvear Palace in Buenos Aires. This is a great game on a cruise ship.
The Peninsula in Hong Kong still may be the dowager champion of all. Everything is perfectly executed starting with our landing. We were picked up at the plane arrival gate deep inside the airport by a hotel cart, driven over a half-mile to immigration, met again in the baggage area, whisked to the limo area where our Mercedes (not the more expensive Rolls) awaited. Upon arrival at the hotel, no annoying check-in lines; we were met and immediately escorted to our harbour view room. Bags arrived instantly and we were left alone after providing a signature and credit card number. All within minutes.
Our room, though smaller than expected based on previous visits, was comfortable with a superb view. We both enjoyed excellent massages the morning after arrival.
We had an excellent rooftop dinner at Felix, enjoying the laser light show across the bay and excellent full breakfasts every morning. Service throughout the hotel is superb.
This is still THE place to stay!"
891,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Amazing Hotel,"I am still overwhelmed by my one night stay in the 'Pen'.
From the moment I stepped out of the taxi I was treated by the staff like a princess.
Check in was seamless and was taken to my room and shown all the facilities.
I was amazed the hotel had remembered I had recently retired and they had left me a tray of handmade chocolates with a chocolate bellboy!
The rooms are luxurious and your every need is catered for. A trip to the lobby for a light lunch is a must, there is an excellent choice of wines and cocktails in the Felix Bar cannot be missed.
Breakfast in the Veranda restaurant was superb-it was superb there is something for every taste, the omelettes superb.
I indulged myself with the Rolls airport limo to take me to the airport for my trip home - what a pleasure I felt like a queen.
Words cannot express my fantastic experience of this hotel."
892,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Best modern hotel in Hong Kong,"Great services, great technology and great location! Has the best breakfast in Hong Kong, with a view to the harbour. Has a new technology that you can access everything from one control. Has a big pool that overlooks the Intercontinental, and great spa services."
893,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Superb,Oh my. What a treat it is to stay at the Peninsula. We arranged for the Rolls airport limo and it was a wonderful way to set the stage for the hotel. The hotel is truly beautiful inside. Our room was incredible and the high tech gadgets in the room are unreal. Must see to believe. The staff was very helpful. Look forward to returning.
894,Date of stay: May 2015,30,"Great Environment, Fantastic Food, Average Service","The hotel has a lovely set out, beautifully decorated. The food spread especially breakfast is absolutely amazing. What is disappointing was the slow service. The restaurant staff seems struggling with their communication skills Could be language capabilities. Overall a pleasant stay."
895,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Wonderful stay,Having disembarked from the Queen Victoria the stay at the Peninsula finished our trip on a very big high. From the moment we arrived to when we left every little thing was just perfect. Staff were very helpful when asked for information getting around Hong Kong. Breakfast was just right with immaculate service. Can't get back soon enough.
896,Date of stay: April 2016,50,"Style, Class, and Service all of the way.....","My family of 4 stayed for 4 nights in the harbor view suite the other day. The suite is beautiful and quite spacious. I do find it strange that they only allow 3 people per room when the room is over 1,000 square feet. There is plenty of room for 2 rollaway beds for the kids. Anyway, getting s suite overlooking the harbor is well worth the money so do it!

The service and technology of the smart room was awesome and the concierge service was fantastic. The tours they set up are overpriced though for what you get....which is a driver that takes you from place to place ad barely talks about the sites.

High tea is not to be missed and the pool/spa/workout areas were superb. We used all of their amenities and were thrilled with everything. My kids loved the pool. The wifi is faster than other 5 star hotels in China too.

Overall the $10k for 4 days of a stay (room/food/tours/spa services/high tea included in that amount) was well worth it and I would do it again."
897,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Excellent stay!,"This hotel is excellent. It was a great retreat after a day exploring Hong Kong. While it is quite pricey compared to other options, it is definitely worthwhile. The best parts of the stay were the pool and spa, the technology in the rooms (surprisingly up to date compared to the historical building), and the staff. The staff are extremely helpful, friendly, and go above and beyond to make your stay enjoyable. (They even posted some shoes that we'd left behind in the wardrobe back to Singapore.) I would stay here again."
898,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Fantastic hotel,This hotel offers to drive from the airport to the hotel with a luxury car (I got picked up with a Rolls Royce). This hotel have really great service and food. This is not a hotel for children or families.
899,Date of stay: November 2015,50,The good old days,"This is the place to visit to see the old Hong Kong. This place have not changed and that is the reason why we always try to visit whenever we are in Hong Kong. It just bring back memories. For folks that have not been there, it is worth spending the time and money to have either High Tea in the lobby or drinks in the bar. There is no comparison you can find."
900,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Interesting location for tourists,"My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula during our last trip to Hong Kong. The Peninsula is in Kowloon, across from the island of Hong Kong and we noticed that the neighborhoods have a vibrancy that was missing elsewhere in Hong Kong. The fish market, flower market and bird market still have a feel for what Hong Kong may have been in times past. People conduct business and social activities with smiles on their faces, smiles that seem to be missing across the bay as locals rush back and forth to work. In addition the historic hotel is lovely, reinforcing the atmosphere of the surrounding community."
901,Date of stay: April 2016,40,Conference,"Very nice environment
People is helpful
Location is convenient to anywhere in the city
The building looks like Europe style make me feel I am not in Asia
Very good service in the business conference room
I will total recommend this place for friends"
902,Date of stay: February 2016,50,The ONLY place to stay,"The Peninsula is, in my humble opinion, the most iconic and beautiful hotel in Hong Kong. Everything from the main entrance to lobby to corridors to rooms oozes elegance and classical grandeur. Service was of course, top notch and there are a few amazing restaurants in the hotel... Gaddi's, Felix and Spring Moon. The hotel is located at Tsim Sha Tsui and you can find virtually everything (shopping malls, bars, convenience stores, local eateries, fine dining, movie theatres, tourist attractions, subway etc) in a 5 minutes (or even less) walk!"
903,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Great Hotel!,"I stayed at The Peninsula twice, and i need to say that is a really great Hotel, great condition, great service from the check to the check out.Nice food for breakfast, good quality, warm staff, and well refined.Nice view from the room in front of HK island, the only thing is the TV, too big and not the right system to get it in the right direction if you lie on the bed, for the rest everything is perfect!"
904,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Lived up to our expectations,"Amazing hotel that really lived up to its iconic status. The service was top notch , the room was fantastic and the bar and restaurants were excellent. We had a deluxe room facing the Hong Kong Island which meant that we got a great view of the light show every night without even leaving our room."
905,Date of stay: March 2016,50,There is NO other place to stay,"The iconic Peninsula is, in my estimation, the only place to stay in Hong Kong. The view across the bay is stunning, the service is over-the-top Asian and perfect, and the location is prime.
Our room was in the original building, and we enjoyed the same amenities as in the new tower, only with higher ceilings. The baths were classic to the hotel, but had all the amenities of a brand-new property.
The spa and indoor pool were breathtaking.
And you can't beat High Tea in the lobby. A must for first time visitors.

If there is a drawback, and by no fault of the hotel, is the incessant sales pitches from fake watch sellers and one-day suit tailors on the nearby Nathan Road and other shopping streets. Surprisingly, they were all Indian or Pakistani. Not Asian.

On a scale of one to 10, I'd give the hotel an 11."
906,Date of stay: April 2016,40,Suite lacked ambiance,"Whilst the Peninsula has so much character and charm in its communal areas, I was disappointed in the suite I was given on the 5th floor of the old building.

Whilst it had all the gadgets one expects of an upscale property, the decor in the lounge area left me feeling cold. It felt like someone had placed a big desk in an office and then placed a spare sofa in the corner.

It was bland decor and needed colour maybe in the form of a nice big painting and/or a rug. Not an inviting environment at all. It was difficult to relax in that space.

Room service was great as was the food they served but choice could be better.

The health club is well run but lacked a relaxation room to cool down in following use of the hot spa and the steam and sauna. Access to the hotel is pretty easy as it is a short walk from TST station."
907,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Classic Elegance,"What a treat to stay at this iconic hotel! My parents stayed here years ago and talk about how wonderful it was and it certainly lived up to its billing. The rooms were beautiful and all had modern upgrades including ipad operated everything which was lots of fun. I loved the gym, sauna, steam and Jacuzzi! The indoor pool was also a perfect place to unwind after a long and raining day of touring the city. We were also fortunate enough to enjoy the spa which was an amazing and relaxing experience. The sauna over looking the harbor, the infared steam room and the rain forest shower were highlights! We loved our stay!"
908,Date of stay: April 2016,50,Room 438,"I had such a great stay for work. The service is fantastic. The food is great for breakfast. And the location is fantastic. I had a noise situation one evening and the manager apologized and I was also greeted the next day with a snack on the table. My night time turn down was done by Amy every night. She is the sweetest. I sent her a nice thank you note at the end and on my last night she put a stunning bouquet of hydrangeas in my room.

Another perk is the golf cart that picks you up at your airport gate. They take you straight to customs. Greet you on the other side and get your bags down to the car. It's amazing. That alone is worth staying at the peninsula over the Intercon!"
909,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Elegant!,"Actually, I booked room for my sister's family years ago. The hotel promoted the room to a suite.
We enjoyed the afternoon tea over there for a couple of times.
No matter inside or outside from the view of the whole hotel, it is a fantastic, pretty and elegant building. Top 5 stars in Hong Kong.

*** The date set the latest is 2015, but I could not pick the earliest ....."
910,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Love to stay here,This hotel is so grand in everything it does but not over the top. I usually travel solo to China and always try to get back to Hong Kong for one night to release in sheer comfort before heading back to the uk. The staff attend to everything you could ever wish for in a 5 star hotel and you are made to feel like royalty the minute you walk in
911,Date of stay: March 2016,50,The Pinnacle,"In terms of urban hotels; you will not find a more well thought out property or more attentive staff. Be prepared, the staff is everywhere, in large numbers! It seemed like if I was thinking I needed something a staff person would show up with what I was thinking about. The food at the Verandah restaurant was simply amazing-I had the breakfast and lunch buffet and was not disappointed. Fresh fish was extremely fresh with a great presentation. Baked goods were also impressive.

The most impressive part of this property are the rooms. Somebody did an amazing job of designing these rooms. The rooms can be totally driven from a moron proof ipad device provided next to the bed. Electronic controls are also located all over the room with very intuitive and simple use. The layout of the bathroom was perfect, the water pressure in the shower was a torrent if wanted. The deep bathtub had a TV easily usable while taking a bath. The blackout curtains, were just that, complete blackout. I could offer no suggestions for improvements for the room.

The gym and locker room were impeccably maintained. The gym (fitness center) had a wide range of aerobic equipment, free weights and machines. There was even a Bosu. The attendant in the fitness center was very helpful and always offering new bottles of water.

In short, or not so short, this is a world class property and rightly deserves the kudos it has received. It is not cheap, but based upon the condition of the property, the amenities and the staff, it is not unreasonably priced.

Cheers to Peninsula--I cannot wait to return!"
912,Date of stay: March 2016,40,Still Worth a Visit,"Stayed for 10 days in early March. This is our 5th visit, the first since the redecoration. Arrived at around 4pm and were amazed at how quiet the lobby was, even though it was tea time. It took a while until we were given a room and we were asked to wait in the reception area. Previous visits were always much more efficient and check in was completed once we were in our room. The first thing that happened in the room was that the staff member removed two very small vases of flowers as she said that the room was set up for some-one else. We have always had flowers in the room on previous visits so this must be a new cost cutting practice. The ipad controls worked very well but the coffee maker is a major problem. We don't drink coffee and the water is not heated to a sufficient temperature to make tea. They also only contain a limited amount of water, so they run out quite quickly. Luckily we brought our own travel kettle and had to buy water from the local supermarket. The hotel do provide a small 300ml bottle of water each in the evening only. When we stayed at the Mandarin while the Peninsula was being refurbished, the water supplied by them was copious and we did not need to buy any whilst there, (they also supply a kettle). We didn't eat in the hotel much, as we were visiting friends and they were recommending restaurants, but we did have the afternoon tea which was beautifully presented, the mini doughnuts are sublime. On previous visits we have mostly been greeted by name by the staff, but on this occasion no-one seemed to make that effort and we were kept waiting quite a time for the tea and asked if we were residents. Residents need to be given better priority for the tea and a special place to wait, not just mill about in the middle of the lobby and hope that a member of staff notices you. We were also charged for a postage stamp for a postcard on this visit which we have never been charged for on our previous visits. On the whole, this is still a very good hotel, but the extra touches that were so wonderful are now lacking."
913,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Wonderful,"All staffs are very friendly and helpful everywhere. Good location, shopping centre, restaurant. The room we stayed is very nice decoration and with a lovely city view of Hong Kong. Good breakfast. Highly recommend to everyone."
914,Date of stay: July 2015,40,"If you want goos dervice, speaks English!","The Peninsular has changed considerably. In the old days, visitors were all British and Americans. Now, rich Chinese customers filled the place

The place is still elegant. But, you should speak in English if you want quick and friendly attention.

The afternoon tea is a must. I had my birthday party there and it was affordable."
915,Date of stay: April 2016,50,the worst thing you can say about this hotel is,"Maybe the pool is a degree or two too warm for lap-swimming. Otherwise, this is the arguably the best hotel in arguably the best hotel chain, possibly the best urban business hotel in the world. It is absolutely amazing, even for an experienced traveler, to contemplate the things they've thought of. Not just the myriad of things that are in every room (and the bedside console controlling your world) but things most people wouldn't even notice. Like you can overlook a really busy street (and in Hong Kong, that describes pretty much every street) and literally not hear a sound. Or the climate control that senses and adjusts to the slightest temperature variation.

Even if you don't like Hong Kong (and I don't -- way too much emphasis on shopping, perhaps because people from the mainland come here for that purpose), it is worth a trip just to stay here."
916,Date of stay: May 2015,50,"Beautiful Hotel, Fine Location, Flawless Service","Beautiful, well-designed suite with a spectacular view across the harbor. Hotel is in a great location, airport pickup (via the hotel's Rolls Royce) was quick and convenient, and hotel staff were wonderful and unobtrusive. Probably the best hotel in Kowloon."
917,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Wonderful afternoon tea - simply perfect,"The Peninsula serves a wonderful afternoon tea - it really is something not to be missed if you visit Hong Kong. The staff are friendly and the food lovely. We arrived a little early and were seated for drinks prior to eating. My family can certainly recommend the Oreo milkshake; probably the best milkshake they have ever had.

Afterwards we visited Ed Tang's in the shopping arcade and bought a stamp and ink pad carved with our names - this was expensive but the workmanship was very good and it was a similar price in the local department store."
918,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Luxury at its finest,"I have always wanted to stay at the peninsula hotel and I'm so glad that I finally did. Modern room with iPad controls such that you don't even have to get out of bed! Very helpful and friendly staff which provided that 5 star service and overall a very luxurious experience. Afternoon tea is a must as well as dining at the Felix, just to experience the view of the harbour. Definitely recommend staying here."
919,Date of stay: March 2016,40,All that U need - and always that extra slize.,"Neat, clean and always extra friendly staff. We stayed with a view towards Kowloon City District; Harbour View is probably better - than more sencationell. Traditional hotel - a most for all exklusice hotellfashionistas out there. Perfect breakfast. Well-equipped gym. Inddor pool. Do you take a car to and from the airport? Upgrade to a RR. Does not cost much extra - always fun to ride in a Rolls-Royce."
920,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Outstanding hotel for Luxury and service,"This hotel is more than worthy of its 5 star rating, location and service leaves nothing to be desired. The deluxe suite was large and choc full of amenities and technology. There was ample wardrobe space and storage.we loved the free wifi as well as the coffee maker. The views from the swimming pool on the 8th floor are to die for, especially at night where you can see the light and laser show over Hong Kong . We stayed over Easter and were very impressed with the decorations Nothing was too much trouble for the staff.
However the food and beverage charges are very expensive not only at the hotel but throughout Hong Kong. I don't know how the average resident survives."
921,Date of stay: March 2016,50,The Peninsula remains a fantastic hotel. A world beater.,"Visiting Hong Kong for the first time before joining the Queen Mary 2. Cunard recommends The Peninsula to its customers and having been here a few days we can see why. This marvellous hotel in Kowloon with its 14 Rolls Royces is an exceptional regal establishment that has the charm and elegance of a bygone age but surprises one with its up to date gadgetry and superb service. We have a beautiful room cum suite on the 23rd floor that overlooks the waterfront of Victoria harbour across from Hong Kong island and The Peak. The views are stunning whether by day or night. Whoever designed this room deserves a medal as it has everything you could wish for and much more....it is just sublime. The 3 ipads that control the tv and sound system, temperature, lights,curtains, air con, services and info are a joy to behold. I would love to take home the bed and the bathroom is beautifully appointed. Add to this the brilliant staff at The Peninsula who are always polite, friendly, helpful and truly professional from our driver from the airport, to the efficient porterage, to a smiling and welcoming receptionist, Martin who escorted us to our room, Cruse, our nightly turndown expert who gave us the lowdown on things to see and finally Sumie an exceptional talent at the info desk who has planned out our 4 days here. Absolutely fabulous. Oh its breakfasts are wonderful and elegantly presented, the spa is spot on and the Felix restaurant on the 28th floor is very popular but not as popular as The Peninsula's afternoon teas which are legendary by the number of people queuing for a table. This is one of the best hotels in the world......perfection."
922,Date of stay: February 2016,50,A Rolls Royce EWB - and what a great hotel,"Now it is not that often that I get surprised about a hotel, and the service, but this is one of the few. Started with the myth with green Rolls Royce transfer from the airport - lovely! And then we continued with a great room with just a GREAT view. And to top it of - they had a fully implemented ""room automation system"" where everything was controlled from a tablet or wall panels (where do I get my hands on them? I would love to have them back home!). I have dreamed about hotels that does this - and finally we found one of them!

This is a hotel with great service, and with the exception for a small window in the afternoon there are more restaurants open than we had time to explore during our stay. However between 14 and 17 or something like that, well no open restaurants... And when I jetlag, I get hungry on different times... Food please?

Oh did I mention the room automation system? ;-) Superb!!!"
923,Date of stay: January 2016,40,"Luxurious, expensive, small room",Very nice lobby with great entrance and beautiful surroundings. we had the most expensive room but we found it to be very small but a beautiful view especially at night. It had a very advanced iPad like device to control everything in the room including the television. A very sophisticated device. The breakfast was included and it was nice. The building is located in a very nice section of town close to all the major attractions. It also has about four different restaurants all of them very good.
924,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Fantastic Room and very nice breakfast....,"We stayed here on a short stop over coming from Boracay back to Europe. The room was big and had all kinds of gadgets and new electronic devices - very high tech. The pool was nice and big - the views from the pool was not as nice as the high floor pool at the Ritz Carlton but it had a nice ""greek bath"" style. I loved the warm and cold mini pools in the changing room. The breakfast was very lovely and had a lot of nice choices.

The one thing that made me a little bit disappointed altho it was a minor detail - i wanted to send two postcards (Hotel postcards) and i had to pay to get them stamped...one would expect, that the Hotel could bare the expense to send a customers postcard free of charge....afterall its a 5* hotel.

Had som trouble with contacting the Emirates chauffeur drive service - but the concierge managede to get it all fixed without any problems....very professional !"
925,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Romantic night,"We books a room to celebrate Christmas. We had a beautiful dinner at Felix, stunning view of the Victoria harbour. The room is bigger then I thought, maintenance is good but not brand new. Service is excellent, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly."
926,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Proper old English courtesy and efficiency,"Lovely hotel, a bell boy in white costume complete with pill box hat opens the front door. It gets better from there. Grand Harbour view room spot on, apart from the clouds. Can't blame the hotel for that. Proper place well staffed with people who are well trained. Lovely experience"
927,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Grand Dame of the East,"Everything the Peninsula does is first class. We were met at the end of the jetway and driven to passport control, then escorted to the Limousine Lounge where the Rolls Royce Limo was waiting to take us to the hotel. We booked using the American Express Platinum Benefits and were upgraded to a suite. We can not say enough about this hotel. We were acknowledged with a hello by all staff wherever we went in the hotel. If you want to experience old world class and charm in Hong Kong this is the place. We have already booked a trip back in October."
928,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Very classy stay,"the atmosphere in the Peninsula was truly stunning, the spa and pool are giving an amazing view onto HK and its a true pleasure to stay there. Its a traditional place and very very nice, loved the room with its views onto the river..."
929,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Exceptional from start to finish...,"The Peninsula in Hong Kong is the flagship property of the Peninsula Hotels group, and is well known as the ""Grand Dame of the East"". So when an opportunity arose for a short trip to Hong Kong, my husband and jumped at the chance to check out the Peninsula flagship and their emerald fleet of Rolls-Royces.

From the beginning, even before we reserved the room, inquiries to the concierge concerning the Rolls-Royce airport transfers were responded to in the most efficient and courteous manner. Needless to say, the Rolls-Royce transfer occurred seamlessly itself: Immediately as you exit the airplane, you are greeted by a staff with your name, then whisked away on a golf court towards the customs line. After ensuring that you've passed through customs without hardship, another Peninsula staff member ushers you towards the Rolls-Royce waiting outside, complete with a white-gloved driver. We highly recommend this unique Peninsula experience!

Upon arrival, we were greeted by a manager (and a startlingly splendid lobby that puts all other hotel lobbies to shame) and escorted to our room. Our suite, the Red Phoenix is beautifully appointed in Asian contemporary style. The suite was very spacious with an unobstructed panoramic view of the harbor. Wi-fi was fast and free.

Throughout our stay we enjoyed the spa and the vast pool. The pool is one of the largest that I have seen for a city hotel and the spa includes a jacuzzi, steam room, and sauna! The buffet breakfast has a varied breadth of both Western and Asian selections

In conclusion, this hotel is exceptional in every respect, from rooms to food, to service and facilities. It is this remarkable feat, of excelling in all aspects, that has made the Hong Kong Peninsula my favorite city hotel in the world."
930,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Still the best,"The welcome was amazing. I arrived early in the morning, around 7ish, I was welcomed by like 3,4 managers! Straight to the suite waiting for me was continental breakfast. The suite was super clean and the service was just excellent. The lobby is kind of messy with non hotel guests though."
931,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Couldn't ask for more...,"As a child, my grandfather and I always dreamed of a visit to Hong Kong. He was well travelled - smart - adventurous - and an amazing person.

I knew he was near the end of his life and I made a dream come to for both of us. The trip to Hong Kong was his last trip. But, for me it will last a lifetime.

The Peninsula is a venerable hotel in an amazing city. The rooms are beautiful, the staff and service - beyond compare.

The property is well located and should be a first choice when considering a stay here."
932,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Beyond magnificent,Stayed for two nights in March at what can only be described as a hotel beyond magnificent. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff who were very accommodating. Quality was the order of the day. How many hotels can there be with toiletries by Oscar de la Renta. Will stay again when in Hong Kong.
933,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Amazing,"Stayed here a few years back and absolutely loved every minute, stayed in one of their standard rooms which was by no means standard!! Wonderful turndown service with Chinese tea every evening & the services of a butler during my stay!
Highly recommend!"
934,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Great Place to stay !,"We had a wonderful room. It was large with a view of the bay. The lights at night were extraordinary.
We had several ""business"" meals in the hotel and they were all delicious.
The staff was ver pleasant and accomodating."
935,Date of stay: March 2016,50,An amazing suite in an excellent hotel,"We stayed for two nights after a Borneo / Philippines cruise ended in Hong Kong. This was the second time we have stayed at the Peninsular and we booked a Grand Deluxe Harbour view room as we had previously because it had wonderful views of Victoria Harbour and across to Hong King island. We were speechless when we were shown to our room to find we had been upgraded to a Deluxe Harbour View Suite ! This had a lounge, huge bedroom and a bathroom which included a corner bath all of which had stunning views. There was also a dressing room. It was so good that we wished we were staying longer than two nights !

We also enjoyed breakfast in our suite on one morning and on the other in the delightful Verandah restaurant with it's extensive buffet and impeccable service. Afternoon tea in the Lobby was also a delight with an extensive choice of fresh sandwiches, scones, cakes and pastries and, although we had missed lunch, we still couldn't finish what we were served.

Finally, we just loved the Rolls Royce transfer from our cruise ship to the Peninsular. It was something very special and will live long with our other wonderful memories of this truly excellent hotel. One of the very best in the world."
936,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Wonderful Hotel!,"The Hong Kong Peninsula is one of the best in the world- the rooms are incredible with stunning views, every conceivable amenity and are very spacious. The staff is very, very helpful ( I would like to especially commend Ms. Echo in the concierge department). In short, this is the epitome of a fine hotel experience!"
937,Date of stay: March 2016,50,The Peninsula Hotel - Heaven,"I was lucky enough to stay at The Peninsula Hotel, Hong Kong and all I can say is it is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. From the moment you walk in you are transported to another time. My room was incredible and the view stunning. Oscar de la Renta bathroom products; you can watch television in the bath and I slept like a Queen in a bed that was so comfortable. Every possible phone charger available, free VOIP calls home and even a nail polish dryer.

The breakfast buffet was incredible and did I mention the service? Anyone who works in the hotel industry should stay here so they can experience what service is.

I could have stayed for a month. Thank you The Peninsula. I have now experienced one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in."
938,Date of stay: March 2016,40,Niceee,"Stayed a night here.

Rooms were well appointed. Very comfortable, great linen, superb toiletries etc. The staff didn't put a foot wrong during my stay.

Lobby Lounge and Breakfast - Service was immaculate although the Ham and Cheese croissant was quite ordinary to put it kindly."
939,Date of stay: March 2016,50,The best in Hk,"I have stayed in a lot of hotels in hong kong but this was the best yet. Impeccable service. I have never seen a more equipped room in my life. The room was large with iPad to control everything. Attention was paid even to smallest of details. The bathroom was also very large as compared to standard HK Size. You need to make sure you experience the high tea. It is also very conveniently located with Canton road only 5 mins away.

A truly remarkable stay"
940,Date of stay: March 2016,50,Fabulous place,"Everything is Perfect
The location,the room,the accommodations,the breakfast..
The cleanest is obviously perfect.
I recommend the pool and the spa ( the view is admirable)
And over all... the service is great (extremely difficult to find better.)
Everybody is sweet ,kind and always ready to help.
Especially the front desk..you can ask everything and they will make sure that you are satisfied.
Merci and bravo."
941,Date of stay: January 2016,50,The BEST city hotel in the world,"I am often asked by friends and colleagues which is my favourite city hotel in the world? The Dorchester, the Connaught, The Savoy, The Manadarin Oriental in San Francisco, Raffles in Singapore - they are all up there!
Well, we stayed at the Peninsula recently. The room was stunning - beautifully designed and equipped, luxurious beyond comparison and a great view of Hong Kong harbour. The restaurant, bars and lounge were all outstanding with particular mention to breakfast and afternoon tea in the lounge/lobby. The SPA was so relaxing and the pool and terrace just perfect.
BUT, the definition of outstanding service is when staff anticipate your needs. They are all so well trained to do just that, and a genuine smile from reception and concierge staff too, is just brilliant.
Finally, to round off our stay, a ride to the airport in one their 17 green Rolls Royces was complemented by a member of the team unloading our baggage, and taking us through the airline check in desk, and refusing a tip!
I want to go back!"
942,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Stunning hotel. Example of quality and perfection,"This is how 5 star hotel should look like. The unique quality and very personal service. Any client should find here his own Peninsula. For me it was a great pleasure have a dinner at Felix, as I love good food and this was the perfect combination of atmosphere and the kitchen by Yoshiharu Kaji. Rooms are big with great view. Service is polite and very competent."
943,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Iconic,"What can I say about this exceptional hotel that hasn't already been said? It's all true!
No detail is left to chance. Everything is perfect. Beyond the lux hotel however, with its venerable afternoon tea and lobby of legend. Venture up! The restaurant and even better the Clipper Club - these places are paradise for a traveler looking for bragging rights. Once there, don't miss the restrooms. Yes, the restaurant restrooms have the best views in the city. I kid you not."
944,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Sensational what a great place,"Just a fantastic experience, from the moment you were picked up in the green Rolls Royce until we checked out. Staff were exceptional. Had a great view of the Harbour. The food at the Restaurants was second to none"
945,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Exceptional stay!,"This place is really amazing, everything is special, the room is not only perfect and with a great harbour view but with many great stuff. You can control everything from lights to curtains and TV and music from a sort of Ipad. Bathroom is big, that is not usual in HK. Service is impeccable. That is one of the best place I ever stay in my life. Of course it is extremely expensive ."
946,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Still the best,"Everyone has to stay here at least once in their lives. It may not be the newest or the tallest or shiniest, but it is the best for service comfort attention to detail and location.
It is the grand lady of the orient. You don't have to leave the hotel if you just want to indulge.
A very special place. Worth every dollar spent."
947,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Best Hotel Ever.,"We loved staying at the Peninsula Hong Kong. Ever since our stay at the Peninsula, we have compared every other hotel we have stayed in to the Peninsula. From the furnishings, the location, the service and small touches, we were extremely happy with our stay in Hong Kong.

We reserved a one bedroom suite. The bedroom was spacious with a connected dressing room/closet. Upon our arrival, we had a beautiful fresh fruit bowl in our living room. The living room had a beautiful work desk, with a printer, fax, many outlets and desk lamp and a phone. There was also a large TV in the living room so my husband could still watch his basketball games back in the U.S. during the early hours in HK.

Beds were comfortable, very quiet room. We also had Afternoon Team and the Peninsula, which was really quite a meal! Some of our friends in the area had thought the Peninsula to be a bit old, but in our experience the Peninsula kept its old glamour and added the amenities of modern luxuries - fast internet connection, modern rooms, clean lines, well kept furniture, impeccable service and responses.

The location is terrific and easy walking distance to shops and the MTR stop (around the corner). Don't miss it. Great place to stay."
948,Date of stay: February 2016,50,Exceeded Expectations at every level,We recently spent three nights at this stunning hotel.Everything was perfect from the staff to the food to the superb room on the 24th floor with the most amazing views over the harbour and Hong Kong island.Very expensive but you do get what you pay for.
949,Date of stay: February 2016,50,OVER THE TOP,"This is definitely the place to stay in Hong Kong. Everything was wonderful from the Rolls Royce pick up at their airport, check in at your room, excellent buffet breakfast, accommodating concierge and a can do attitude. Our room was a deluxe room with a view of the water. I couldn't think of staying in any other room. We stayed over New Years and one evening we came back to find red envelopes on our pillows. What a nice detail. The New Year's Day show was fantastic. We used the hotel driver for a day and it was an excellent day. What a wow to see the city in style. We covered so much ground and the driver spoke perfect English. We hated to check out of the hotel. Can hardly wait to return to our new home away from home."
950,Date of stay: February 2016,50,best in the world,"It is everything they say and more.
Incredible views. Great location. Polite and charming staff. Amazing bars. Best breakfast spread anywhere in the world. Room is so loaded with technology that all works and is easy to use. Incredible shower. Incredible gym. I was slightly disappointed the pool was being serviced and closed, but who cares? It was so great!
I topped off my visit with a trip to the airport in their house car.... What an experience!!"
951,Date of stay: January 2016,40,"A very special place, indeed.","Absolutely wonderful stay in Hongkong.
Great fun with (as in most of the Peninsula Hotels) electrical features and tablets.
Service among the best I have experienced, concierge, room service, pool, location, ...
you name it, everything is perfect.
Great view, I guess, but limited due to bad air.
I do not recommend tea in the lobby though, too many people are running around, waiting in line, a rather hectic place, no original colonial spirit. Too bad,
heritage was not overly cherished.
But take the Rolls Royce to the Airport,
The Hotel provides a lot for beautiful memories.
Thank you"
952,Date of stay: January 2016,20,Maybe I expected too much,"As the title says, maybe my expectations were too unrealistic and was then disappointed. Came for a weekend getaway with my wife as we always wanted to experience the grand dame. Somehow the flair was missing. Staff seemed to be distant and not very interactive. Rooms were too dark for our taste. The restaurants are nice but Hong Kong as many great restaurants for cheaper prices and probably the same or better quality. When we arrived early, room wasn't ready which is fine with us just would have expected an extra care. As I said, maybe I expected too much."
953,Date of stay: January 2016,40,Treat yourself you are worth it,"Peninsula, Hong Kong.
What can one say. We had had an indifferent holiday, so on the way back I booked some nights here. It was awesome. A car to pick us up, 'High Tea' on the first afternoon, 'Afternoon Tea' on the second. Amazing breakfast's that could last you all day. Helpful staff. And at the end of the stay a ""Rolls Royce"" to take us to the airport to head home. I am treating us whenever we fly through Hong Kong to stay at this place. Its refurbished and if you keep your eye out for their special offers a lot cheaper than you think."
954,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Grande Dame Hotel in Hotel in Hong Kong,"First opened in 1928, The Peninsula Hotel is the iconic and oldest hotel in Hong Kong. It is considered to be the Grande Dame Hotel in the far east. It is a 5-star luxury hotel with the three lower floors comprising the Peninsula Arcade, a high end and luxury fashion establishments like Prada, Louis Vuitton, Cartier, Ralph Lauren, etc. It is located at the corner of Nathan Road and Salisbury Road, across from the HK Cultural Center. It is in the Tsim Sha Tsui district of Kowloon. Rates can go from US$ 500 to US$ 3000. The magnificent view overlooking the Hong Kong harbour comes with the high priced rooms. The Peninsula is famous for its white gloved chauffeured driven green Rolls Royce that picks up clienteles from the airport. VIPs, dignitaries, celebrities, head of states, movie stars, and the like, are frequent guests of the hotel. A hotel not for everyone, unfortunately."
955,Date of stay: February 2016,50,It doesn't get any better,"Our grand deluxe harbor view room on the 22nd floor was perfect. The view was spectacular night and day! The furniture, furnishings, bathroom and hi tech controls were excellent. Breakfast at the Verandah was very good and the service was excellent. The hotel's Rolls Royces were superb as were the related services and the cost was reasonable. There's no reason to stay anywhere else in Hong Kong unless cost is a factor but the hotel is well worth the cost."
956,Date of stay: November 2015,50,In a word ... exceptional,"From check in to check out the Peninsula is 1st class - exceptional service from housekeeping to restaurants.
It's pricey but you're buying an experience - Make sure to have breakfast around the pool."
957,Date of stay: January 2016,50,"Classic Hotel, Legendary Property","My husband and I disembarked from a cruise in Hong Kong and booked two nights at the Peninsula. After a shaky start: we had requested early check-in well in advance, and we weren't given our room until after 2:00. When our room was still ""not ready"" at 2:00, we told the front desk to find us another room. (our friends from the cruise had their rooms ready by noon, we all booked via AMEX with upgrades) We did not get an overview of the room with many high tech controls and features when checking in. I would insist on this because there are so many control pads, recessed mirrors, drapes controls that are automated.
Regarding the hotel: it is truly one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. Its beautiful, with every modern amenity. Most importantly, the bed and linens are heavenly! Ive never slept so well. We had a Deluxe suite facing away from the harbor on the 23rd floor. It was fabulous! The decor is modern and warm. The bathrooms are large and have wonderful toiletries. The bedside tables have a drawer with several types of cables to charge a variety of devices from iPhones to Android. A wonderful feature, no search for the right outlet or need for converters. The staff is polished and efficient. The young men in the lobby luggage area are super accommodating!
The restaurants are incredible. We had a Dim Sum luncheon at the Chinese restaurant, Spring Moon, with recommendations from our waiter. It was delicious, fresh, high quality! Judging from the majority of locals in the restaurant, it must be very highly regarded in Hong Kong. (Other highly recommended Dim Sum restaurants we tried paled in comparison with respect to food, cleanliness, and decor.) The ambience in Spring Room is stunning and evokes a 1920's Chinese restaurant with dark wood, antiques, and beautiful carpets.
Another evening we ate at the Japanese restaurant, Imasa, and had amazing sushi, tempura, wagyu beef, again with recommendations by the waiter. Service was excellent except we had to hunt down the waiter to get our check.
The breakfast buffet in The Veranda was exquisite. Every breakfast preference is there, eggs cooked to order, Asian selections, European choices, yogurts, gorgeous fresh fruits, pastries. The ambience is lovely, elegant, hushed, and comfortable with gorgeous floral arrangements of yellow orchid sprays. I wish we could have stayed another few nights to really enjoy the incredible selection of every cultural offering.
We had cocktails up in Felix bar for the beautiful view of the harbor skyline and the light show. The cocktails were absolutely perfect and the bar is very fun.
We tried cocktails in the lobby our last evening while we waited for our transport to the airport. Service was really spotty, the waiter kept forgetting things, brought a few of us our food and cocktails, and then dropped the ball by forgetting the others at the table. He was clearly too spread out. I would not recommend the lobby for food.
In spite of the few detracting problems. I would stay here again... and again! It is a work class hotel with beautiful details. How I wish we could have had time to use the pool and spa. I would love to return- perhaps when the high speed bullet train is completed with service to Shanghai!"
958,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Amazing Stay,"We stayed here during a stopover. From the moment we arrived the service was amazing. We were lucky and got a room with a view in the original part of the hotel. Our room was gorgeous and to be honest I would have stayed here but we obviously had to see Hong Kong. It is so easy to walk everywhere from here and it is near to the Star Ferry as well, which is a must do. Breakfast here was a feast and it is up there with the great hotels. We had stayed in the original Raffles and this is in the same class. They knew how to build hotels in those days. The staff were amazing and genuinely helpful."
959,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Iconic Kowloon hotel with fabulous harbour views,"Thsi was my first visit to the Peninsula, and often try and stay at least once in an hotel with not only a glorious colonial past, but also with a high level of customer service, comfort and amenities.
The entrance into the Peninsula is impressive, with its two loung-bar areas either side, before making your way into the Lobby.
The hotel has an excellent choice of cuisine (several different restaurants), and the breakfast buffet is well stocked and varied.
I chose a harbour-view room which was exceptional, with good comfort and including the latest e-gadgets !
For those of you who wish to avail, the airport transfer (one way or return) in their fleet of Rolls-Royce's, is a privilege but well worth the experience !
The hotel's position in lower Kowloon is very practical for shopping and other visits, and is only a 5 minute walk from the emblematic Star Ferry Terminal.
Enjoy your stay.!"
960,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Had to come back,"I was here in 1970 for a week out of Vietnam. I was and wanted to show friends where we had stayed. The city has grown and many changes, most for the good. The Peninsula Hong Kong is a great now as it was then. The service is exceptional and if you do nothing else be their early for tea. A taxi to and from the airport OK but why not one of the RR to add to your pleasure."
961,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Colonial Glory.,We checked in a family of four early one morning directly from the airport and were offered a room immediately. The quality of this hotel is without question the location food and rooms are all as you would expect. The overall differential is the service and high standards to help with reservations in a relaxing environment. We will be back for afternoon tea. Excellent.
962,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Best luxury hotel and best views of Hong Kong,"I stayed at The Peninsula Hong kong during december 2015.
As soon as you entry the lobby you can feel the glamour of the property, The staff always welcoming and helpful. The rooms are really big for the Hong Kong standards and the views that you want to see in Hong kong are definitely the ones you see from The Peninsula(From Koloown side) . This beautiful skyline cannot be seen from the other side of the island (Hong Kong Island), so definitely this is the place to stay!!! Don´t miss the afternoon tea with live classical music and a swim in the beautiful pool)
Recommended 100%!"
963,Date of stay: January 2016,50,"I""ve always wanted to stay here and this Grande Dame didn't disappoint.","Having spent many a holiday in Hong Kong since my childhood it was always my dream to stay in this iconic HKG landmark hotel. This trip travelling home to Australia from London I chose to break the long journey for a 2 night (3 days) stay with my 2 daughters. I was very much looking forward to our stay and despite receiving advice way in advance that the swimming pool area was closed for refurbishment during our dates, which was disappointing, we still were blown away by this wonderful hotel! Our room was beautiful and the kids were fascinated by the I Pad style control panel which was very easy to navigate and could virtually make a morning coffee. I loved that the room decor reflected its Chinese heritage but in a contemporary style and was superbly appointed.The bathroom was very spacious even for 3 persons and we had loads of cupboard and storage space which was important as we had rather a lot of baggage. We enjoyed our breakfasts in the lobby area and The Verandah buffet (our favourite) and my girls were appreciative of the complimentary movie channel to relax whilst I went shopping. We have stayed in the Peninsula Los Angeles, Bangkok and now Hong Kong and this hotel was my favourite, yet my girls preferred LA as they loved their swimming pool area. We will need to return to see whether the HKG pool will change their opinion and I too would most happily choose another stay in this beautiful hotel. Many thanks also for our complimentary extended check out time of 4pm."
964,Date of stay: January 2016,40,once more a great hotel in Hongkong,"The pool and spa were closed for whatever. A certain compensation for ex free breakfast would have been appreciated.
Room very nice comfortable and clean. Service all over just TOP. Hotel all over very clean."
965,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Luxury all the way,"From the time we made reservations we felt that this was the right place. Very efficient. We were met in the arrival hall at the airport and escorted all the way to the limo. Best ride ever in the Rolls.
Warm welcome at the hotel and in room check in. Thw whole team was wonderful, HK, food and beverage, concierge, chefs and the door men/women. Very friendly wand warm. Ms Alice Chan, Echo and Kenneth were the super stars. The food in all outlets is outstanding. We tried all. Spa is magical. The pool was under renovation but the area was big and sensational views.
The Peninsula rooms are good and very comfortable and luxurious. Its in the middle of every thing. The team really looked after us. We had a very relaxed holiday.

Thank you very much Peninsula Hong Kong Team"
966,Date of stay: December 2015,40,Good facilities not so good staff,"The facilities re really great. The pool is lovely overlooking harbour. The locker area has good facilities. Steam room, sun, jacuzzi and cold pool. The room is very modern. I love the unlimited movies. I just don't appreciate the staff of Reception, they look tired and not very willing to assist. Not smiling while talking to guests. Concierge is very helpful, they gave us information how to go to Macau."
967,Date of stay: February 2015,50,PERFECT!,"We stayed in the harbor suite (or sth like that).
The room was huge and bright with a view towards the space museum (a dome shaped building) and the harbor front.
Staff was very polite. There were fresh fruit (huge basket), champagne (ok, more like sparkling wine) and chocolates (it's their very famous chocolates!) welcoming us readily available on the dining table.
Can't complain, as the first thing going into the bright room had already lightened me up.

After all, it's peninsula."
968,Date of stay: November 2015,50,What can you say? it's the Peninsula.,"My wife and I had previously stayed at the Peninsula in Bangkok and loved it, so when planning our trip to Hong Kong, there was no question that we had to give The Mothership a try. It did not disappoint. We stayed at the Hong Kong Peninsula for four nights in mid-November 2015. When we checked in, the staff member said that they tried to match our preferences from our last stay at the Bangkok Peninsula (which was three years prior). They remembered our anniversary and had a bottle of champagne, a cake, and chocolates waiting for us.

As for our accommodations, we were upgraded to the Coral Suite which I can say without exaggeration is the most comfortable and tastefully appointed hotel suite I've ever had the pleasure to stay in. This is to say nothing of the *awe-inspiring* view of Victoria Harbor from the suite. We never closed our drapes, even at night, because the view was so amazing. As many have noted, the electronics have been updated and the suite was provided with three Samsung tablets that allowed you to control everything, order room service, etc. Having stayed in some outstanding suites in the past, it was nice to be able to turn on and off all of the many lights without having to solve a puzzle.

As far as the amenities:
- The food served at the restaurants and via in-room dining was outstanding. The breakfast buffet was excellent. We were provided with a ""Culinary Journey"" of the hotel's restaurants as part of our stay. While neither my wife nor I are huge fans of authentic Chinese food, the steak at Gaddi's (the French restaurant) may be the best I've ever had. Drinks at Felix (the penthouse bar) with yet another stunning view was a great way to end the evening.
- The spa was fantastic, so good in fact that we came back for massages while we were staying at Hotel Icon. The thermal treatment area (steam room and sauna) is the best I've ever seen. The sauna has a view of the harbor as well.

Note that in addition to the Peninsula, my wife and I also stayed at the Upper House and Hotel Icon while in Hong Kong and I've done reviews for both of those hotels. The Hong Kong Peninsula is an incredible blend of traditional glamour, efficient modernity, and incredible service. It exceeded every lofty expectation I had. We loved our stay there and I can't see how anyone wouldn't. If you are looking for a unique Hong Kong experience, look no further.

ps - don't worry about the Kowloon vs. Hong Kong Island debate. The Peninsula is right next to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR stop and you can be at Central or the Admiralty on Hong Kong Island in roughly ten minutes. Plus the views of the harbor are much better from the Kowloon side."
969,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Ticked off the list...,"Living in Hong Kong for nine years and always wanted to try this place out. We did the dine and fly package and added a nights accommodation on top for fun.

The service was good, as you would expect, but nothing extra ordinary. The room was amazing, it was packed with every possible piece of tech that you could cram into the space. Everything had been thought of, right down to the tiniest details.

I've stayed in hundreds of hotels and this room would definitely be up there as number one in tech fit out. Not the most spectacular room, but warm and tasteful.

Definitely go for the harbour view."
970,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Perfection!,"We had wanted to stay in the Pen for a while and decided that my wife's ""big birthday"" was the time to do it. Our two night stay was perfect, from the Chinese tea to welcome us through to the check out. We had a tower harbour view room looking straight over towards Wanchai. It had everything you needed and most of it operated by iPad. I had preordered a bottle of champagne to celebrate and they had also left a beautiful birthday cake for my wife. The service was amazing throughout, from the restaurants (Veranda, Spring Moon and Chesa), room service and the spa and pool. The pool was amazing, even though we couldn't sit outside due to the rain. Our final morning found us with the pool to ourselves. Everything was immaculately kept, the changing areas were spotless. We will be returning, it's our favourite hotel in Hong Kong."
971,Date of stay: December 2015,40,"Pretty good, but slightly disappointed","Our family was excited to stay at the HK Peninsula, considered to be a HK landmark. It was good, but for the cost of the rooms, we expected a little better. We went from our stay at the HK Peninsula to the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai and the Waldorf in Shanghai was by far a superior stay for a third of the price of the Peninsula with way better service.

Rooms: Great rooms with great beds and bedding. The rooms are modernized and the lights, curtains, TV, etc can be turned on and off with the touch of a button. They have room darkening blinds which is a great bonus. The toiletries are Salvatore Ferragamo and they smell great.

Restaurant: We ate at their Chinese restaurant and the food was very nice. Breakfast was a bit underwhelming for the price and we were disappointed that they ran out of certain foods 30 minutes before breakfast ended.

Service: Overall, good serve, but nothing compared to what we experienced at the Waldorf Astoria in Shanghai or the Four Seasons in Guangzhou and Chiang Mai.

Overall, I don't think it's worth the price... for the stay or even breakfast."
972,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Superb,"I am still here and report that this is a superb hotel.

The pluses: excellent staff and customer service, superb rooms, wonderful facilities, the views are fabulous and the atmosphere in the lobby is wonderful.

Minuses . The room was not very big, the toilet cistern filled a bit slowly and the prices are high. The Felix bar was not that interesting.

Overall . Thank you."
973,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Top dollar but living up to it.,"On a recent family holiday we decided to splash out on a one night stay in The Peninsula in Hong Kong. Originally we had wanted to stay longer in this hotel but as only 1 extra bed for a kid is allowed per room we were forced to either get 2 adjoining rooms or a suite. We chose the latter and so had to splash out a fair bit of money for our 1 night stay. Luckily it was worth it. The suite with harbour view in the old part of the building was amazing. Huge, luxurious to the extreme and full of little brilliant details. We had a fantastic time and if we come back I dare say we do it all over again!"
974,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Special in every way,"We stayed for three nights and loved it, the setting, the style, the food and drink and the service. We started with the Rolls Royce transfer from the airport - we were actually met at the sky bridge off the plane and whisked through the airport on a buggy, plane to car in 15 minutes!!!
Food and drink at the hotel are expensive but hey you are in one of the best hotels in the world..
Would we stay again, absolutely."
975,Date of stay: December 2015,50,One of my favourite hotels in the world!,"I started my honeymoon in Hong Kong and stayed at the Peninsula along with the Four Seasons. I can not say enough about this hotel, it was incredible! From the moment you arrive at the Peninsula you feel welcome, pampered and like you are arriving home. The staff and the service is honestly some of the best I have ever experienced -- and I stay in a lot of five star hotels. This hotel has a soul to it that is so luxe and focused on the guest experience that you feel totally at ease.

The hotel rooms are not huge (at least mine wasn't) but they are extremely well appointed and have everything you need. I have never stayed in a better organized hotel room. Every little thing that you could think of needing while you travel has a place in the room with a label. Its an organized travellers dream....and if you can't find what your looking for the rooms are equipped with ipads that allow you to order anything you need down to controlling the lights and curtains.

We were there at Christmas and the added magic of their christmas decor was especially charming. The pool has an incredible view, the food is excellent and the hotel is beautiful.

The only negative is the location. For western visitors who desire to be on the island side this hotel is located in Kowloon...that being said I had the ferry and uber situation figured out very quickly and was Hong Kong island side in 30mins."
976,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Elegant hotel totally remodeled three years ago,This Hotel is 86 years old but it was totally remodeled three years ago so the inside devices are up to date. You can control the TV with iPad on the nightstand and you can use their VoIP phone to call international for free. The gym is located on the seventh floor and the heated swimming pool is on the eighth floor with great view to look over the Victoria Harbour
977,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Elegant and regal.,Whether from the inside or outside this hotel is elegant and regal. On a December night the front of the hotel looks like it is straight out of a beautiful fairy tale. Stop in for afternoon tea to be treated like royalty.
978,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Elegant,"Fabulous hotel. Wonderful service, fabulous food and elegant decor. The hotel is very well located and convenient to access. Hong Kong is a fun city and this place will make your stay even more special. Very pleased with my stay."
979,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Fantastic rooms and great service,Stayed for 3 nights on the 'suite deal' and was upgraded to an extremely impressive suite (the one in the Richard E Grant hotel program). Amazing views of the harbour. Service was excellent throughout in the suite with many great little touches to make the stay very enjoyable. The food in main buffet breakfast restaurant is excellent and the service exemplary when it's not too busy (they get a bit swamped when it's full and miss a few details). we were a bit miffed when we went for a drink in the bar before visiting Gaddis when the maitre de told my wife (nicely) that she needed to change her shoes if she came in again (they have a no flip flop rule but these where sandals with a back!). Gaddi's restaurant is very good too.
980,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Beautiful hotel with elegance,"We wanted wrap up our 4 weeks long wonderful vacation at the Peninsula hotel. We are familiar with the hotel (mainly Restaurants and lobby lounge) from our time in Hongkong during ’75-’81. The restaurants are called still the same, serving the same Swiss and French cuisine like old days. Brought us back lots of good old memories.. We liked ultra-modern features in the room. The welcome Chinese tea service upon arrival in the room was charming. Enjoyed the good night’s sleep bed mattress. The service was great from checking in to checking out. Christmas was approaching so the lobby was beautifully decorated with Christmas elegance. I live in Europe. There are lots of old beautiful historical hotels but the Peninsular HKG is still outstanding. Can’t wait till our next visit."
981,Date of stay: January 2016,50,Best Hotel in Hong Kong,This is probable the best luxury hotel in Hong Kong. The location in situated at the harbour front of tsim sha Tsui and busiest Nathan Road. The subway to everywhere just just outside the door way. The lobby and room decorations are most classic and beautiful. All room facilitated will electronic device remote control. All stuff inside the room are super high quality. I particular love the spa music inside the bath room. I go tgt with kids and joining the new year count down ball at lobby floor. That was the best ball in town and mark a splendid beginning of the year. All staff of the hotel will offer a show for the guests. The service here is definitely the best of the best. I m so proud of Hong Kong able to have such a good managed and luxury hotel. Will visit and come again and again with family for sure.
982,Date of stay: January 2016,20,Not best venue for Netflix and Chill,"Spending New Years night here at the Pen in Hk. I must say i was looking forward to this stay was have been completely let down.

The first room a checked in to (non smoking room and floor) had a strong cigarette odor. One of the front desk personal came into the room and was also shocked at how strong it was.

They moved my room (got a call from manager which was a nice touch)

So now that im settled in I must say that overall the room is very unique and high tech. The bed if quite firm but my realization is that firm beds are the norm here in asia - so its understandable.

Last evening the sounds of trickling water awoke me - seems like my neighbor upstairs was taking a bath and I guess the plumbing lines were not properly insulated for acoustics.

So all the above listed didnt really drive me crazy - but this next bit is what really grinds my gears.

The TV in the room does not angle to the bed - so after a long day and night out all i wanted to do was watch a movie under the covers and that was a no go. This really disappointed me - for such a fine property you would think such an important detail like this would not be overlooked. They have every corner of the room wired up with a touch pad control - but to not be able to do something that can be done in virtually every hotel room in the world (watch tv in bed) is a total demerit in my eyes.

Hope this review serves as constructive criticism - as such a spectacular property deserves better."
983,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Excellent,"So Beautiful . Had my Dinner there on 2nd night at Hong kong . The Peninsula Hotel illumination is one of the best . Will be my next hotel when i will be back to Hong Kong . Amaizing experience , impeccable service . Excellent food. Will be back."
984,Date of stay: November 2015,50,There is a reason James Bond stayed here!!!,"Where to begin!! We took the option of using the Rolls Royce service from the airport! Despite being an international flight, their was a man to meet us at the jet bridge. He took us through immigration, would have got our bags if we'd checked any and then took us to our waiting Rolls Royce! Incredible car!
Because we'd used this service, we met at the hotel by a super friendly manager who took us to our room where we did the check in formalities.
The room was amazing!! So high-tech with amazing thoughtful features...such as (to name a few) a TV in the bath, charging cables in the bedside table for most phones, everything digitally controlled from various iPads and other touch screens. Truly luxurious!!
The lobby bar and The Bar have strict dress codes, even for residents which is a bit tough. The lobby bar especially. I was in tailored shorts and a shirt with casual shoes....but no service. This was the only disappointing part of an otherwise amazing experience. We did get into The Bar on our second night, by purchasing a pair of trousers at the Ladies Market...that actually cost less than a beer at the bar!! Review of The Bar separately."
985,Date of stay: December 2015,50,So beautiful Christmas illumination,"I just visited here on Christmas.
It's so beautiful illumination.
Cars can't drive Christmas night in main area HK. So many people enjoy Christmas atmosphere on the road.
There are many place has decorated
in HK. But The peninsula Hotel illumination is the best. It's simple color, but so that it's fantastic."
986,Date of stay: December 2015,50,A magical stay!,"Mys tay in the Peninsula was excellent, the view was magnificent, the rooms luxurious and the pool was very nice and had a nice view. The staff is also very friendly and the gala room is very useful for big events."
987,Date of stay: December 2015,50,"Exceptional, truly 5 Star","Amazing experience, from the moment you arrive. Impeccable service, gorgeous rooms. Suggest a deluxe courtyard room if you can. Nothing is too much for the staff to accommodate your every need. Try Felix restaurant on the 28th floor if you get a chance with a view of Hong Kong Harbour

3 iPads in room to open curtains, order ice and free movies - all at the swipe of a finger from bed!"
988,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Peninsula,"This hotel is very luxuous, the breakfast is amazing !!! The cars are exceptional! The rooms are also quit big but unfortunately kind of pricy ! The service is really good!!!! You can get a tourist guide, btw they are very nice!!! The restaurans are delicious!"
989,Date of stay: November 2015,50,A magical place to stay,Upon arriving at the airport and being picked up in there signature green rolls. We knew it was going to be over the top experience. the harbor view room was fantastic each evening and sunrise you were greeted with fantastic views of the buildings dancing with color neon. The veranda breakfast were fantastic with so many choices. The culinary journey we did where we had bites in four of the restaurants was a great experience and worth it. The congiere staff were extremely helpful with suggestions. That all worked. Service by all was wonderful.
990,Date of stay: December 2015,50,Fantastic,"Fabulous hotel in a great location. We stayed here for 3 nights on our way to Europe and in December the xmas decorations and fairy lights make it even more special especially arriving at night. The lobby area good for coffee or casual dining. High Noon Tea very popular but didn't try it as was too busy.
The spa, gym and pool area is one f the best I have been in. Great rooms and a very comfortable bed with luxurious linen!
Expensive but worth it......."
