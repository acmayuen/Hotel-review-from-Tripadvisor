0,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Perfection!,"Me and my family have stayed at the hotel in late August and frankly speaking we were really disappointed. The Kowloon view room in the new building was very small, view was ordinary and the service was not satisfying. After a month, we spent another 2 nights in a harbor view deluxe suite, and the experience was perfect. We arrived at 2 pm and there were no queue waiting for checking in. We booked a harbor view superior suite and they offer us an upgrade since the trip was to celebrate my parents' birthday. The cake flower were there waiting for us on the table. The suite was very spacious and the most amazing part was the bathroom. A bathtub overlooking Kowloon!

On the second day during our stay, which was mid-autumn festival, we were given four Spring Moon mooncakes, which was by far the most delicious mooncakes I've ever had.

The service has prominently improved. Most waiters and waitresses even remembered which suite we stayed at, we don't have to inform them our room number when we were making requests at the front desk.

Overall a very pleasant stay, we totally enjoyed it. Suites in the Peninsula HK would be an important component for a perfect holiday in HK!"
1,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Very close to being perfect,"My husband and I have just finished a 3 night stay at this wonderful property. There are many wonderful things to say but here are the highlights:
The room was absolutely superb. We were on the 27th floor in a Harbour grand delux room. Amazing views. Room was beautifully appointed with many thoughtful additions such as the iPad like room controls that were very easy to use. The only small niggles were the very occasional gush of cold water when showering and as per usual not electrical sockets near a mirror ( my personal gripe as most hotel rooms are clearly designed by men who have no thought for a guests need to use their own hairdryer or straighteners!!!)
The restaurants and bars are as you would expect a classy establishment to have. The choice of wines and cocktails didn't disappoint.
I had 2 treatments in the spa - sheer heaven. The pool area is stunning.
Overall this is the best hotel we have stayed in in HKG.
We only had one issue and that was with the concierge when booking a cab back to the airport. We clearly stated a taxi cab and he offered the helicopter , then the hotel Mercedes. We said no could we have a normal taxi. On checking out at 4.45am we found it was the Merc. We felt we had to accept as the bill was by then in the middle of being processed and the driver was already there."
2,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Total delight,"The Rolls Royce experience on arrival at HK airport is wonderful. First time we have ever been met airside directly off the plane & whisked though security, baggage reclaim & guided smoothly to a waiting Rolls. On arrival at the hotel, we were met at the door & taken directly to our deluxe harbour view room on the top floor. So nice not to have to queue/hang around at a check in desk. Lovely room, enormous bed, divine bedding, great view. Lots of technology in the room but all very simple to operate. We had a quick swim in the morning. Pool was gorgeous & we could have happily idled away a few hours here. Breakfast was good although service was not too sharp. On the first morning of our stay there was only one waiter on duty & he seemed to disappear from time to time so we had to wait a while for coffee & coffee refills. Staff otherwise were totally professional, personable & attentive. Sadly we only had 2 nights here which was all too brief but we loved our stay &, as we sat in the Rolls for our journey back to the airport, we reflected on how delightful our stay had been."
3,Date of stay: January 2015,50,HOME,"This is our HOME in HK. Warm perfect services delivered always in a friendly perfect way. The new rooms, the lobby and the swimming-pool are just 3 examples of perfection. Ideal for business or leisure trips. One of the best 5L hotels in the world if you ask me."
4,Date of stay: November 2015,50,"Oh my, oh my, what a delight","The view from a high floor overlooking the harbor is just perfect. The huge window, thoughtfully double-glazed to keep the room quiet, presents one of the great water views of the world: the immense and delightfully busy Hong Kong harbor plus the astonishing line-up of skyscrapers shoulder-to-shoulder along the sea front and beyond. And the room itself -- as up-to-date as this traveler has ever seen, with three iPads to control lights, open and close curtains, adjust temperature and fan speeds, view lists of hotel restaurants, and on and on. Breakfast in the room is pretty much a must, as it allows you to see the great city coming to life, the ferries dashing about to one island or another, the tugs and barges and container ships lugging goods from one place to another. As the day develops the display will expand to include tourist boats and occasional Seriously Rich Guys in their Seriously Big Boats passing by. The bed is perfect, the amenities over the top, the toilet flushing a bit cranky, and the spacious and powerful shower the best we've ever enjoyed in a hotel...or anywhere else. We didn't use the TV, but it was enormous. The staff were highly accommodating and professional. The concierge services were extremely well informed and helpful. We got a special package deal, so while the bill was a thumping one, we survived."
5,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Best Hotel of the World,"I love the hotel, the service is outstanding, the rooms amazing. By far : the Best hotel in HK. All the food outlets are amazing, not to mention, do not forgot to pass by the Gift Shop, very cute!
It is also the best afternoon tea in town."
6,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Is this still the best hotel in the world?,"Yes I think it is (not that I have been to them all!).Rather than list the things that the Peninsular does spectacularly well which are well covered in this forum I thought I would identify a couple of areas which they may care to address in order to stay at the top. After all if you stand still something will come up and bite you and as we know nothing stands still in HK.
1 ""Its not you its your guests""
Maintaining standards must be at the top of the Agenda. Difficult territory this but I find it unacceptable to see a guy in shorts and singlet eating his donuts from a box and swilling coffee from a starbucks cup sitting in the middle of the lobby as I eat my own breakfast. The situation needs to managed by skilled staff.
I also find it unacceptable to having dinner in one of the restaurants with two guys at the next table watching a basketball game on a handheld device with the sound on and clearly audible to the room. Once again a situation that should be proactively managed.
2 The service/gratuity dilemma.
One or the other please but not both. After adding a 10% service charge to the bill (That's OK for me as service is outstanding) to leave a blank gratuity box is confusing. I am quite to able to reward staff with a further gratuity if warranted. For the first time at this hotel I was also aware of some open solicitation of gratuity in one of the restaurants in addition to the service charge. Not acceptable to me.
Finally we had a great stay and the front desk was outstanding. If only you could wrap it up with your Christmas ribbon and sent it every five star hotel in the world I would rejoice."
7,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Amazing luxury hotel with some history,"We opted for the rolls royce airport transfer service which although expensive was a great way to start our trip after a 13 hour flight from Vancouver.

Upon arrival at the hotel we quickly shown to our harbour view room for in room check in. The view was incredible facing Hong Kong island. The grand harbour view room was a good size and included everything you could ask for. The room is controlled by the provide iPads; very hi tech. Room included a king bed, desk area, lounge chair and bathroom with tub and separate shower. The room appeared to be recently renovated and was in excellent condition.

Breakfast was included in our room rate which we decided to have at the pool each day and it was great.

The pool area is very nice with great views of the hong kong skyline.

The common areas were great although overrun by tourists at some times."
8,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Perfection,"Impossible to criticise what year after year only becomes better. The Peninsula (The Grand Old Lady) is like a good Bordeaux, it gets better with time. The rooms have been refurbished again and bring the latest technology. Beds are perfect and the linen probably one of the best I have ever experienced. Do ask and pay the premium for a Harbour view room.
Simply Perfect stay !"
9,Date of stay: October 2015,50,A place I call home while visiting Hong Kong,"Staff is very friendly and helpful. You find history every corner you turn. Though the high tea is praised by most people, I find it quite ordinary. Location is great, near the harbor and subway.
The room is spotless clean. There isn't a streak on any glass or metal surface. In room coffee machine is provided which is a huge plus. The dresser (for ladies) is a gem! All lighting and electronic devices are controlled by the pads on the night stand. The bed is HEAVENLY! I enjoyed the stay so much that I'd naturally called it ""home"" while I was heading back to the hotel after a day exploring the city."
10,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Luxurious,"This is the top address in Hong Kong if tradition means something to you! The lounge, all the different restaurants offering a wide variety of different food. Friendly service all around, very attentive and professional. The Pen is a must when in HK!"
11,Date of stay: February 2015,50,One of the best in the world...,"The title says it all. There's nothing I can write that'll do this hotel justice. Staying at any Peninsula is an experience within itself.

The rooms, staff, food, view, everything... is just phenomenal.

A couple of things you need to experience:
High Tea - If you're a guest you get to bi-pass the long line.
Breakfast - The best buffet in the world, bar none.
Felix's - Probably the best view in Hong Kong. Fantastic food.

Practically - The hotel is located very close to Nathan Road and Harbour City. Only a few minutes walk to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station and the Star Ferry Pier - both will take you over to Hong Kong Island."
12,Date of stay: October 2015,50,The original hotel in the world's best hotel group,"There is nothing like a Peninsula hotel, and the Hong Kong Peninsula is the Grand Dame of the group.
World's best service. Everything was perfect. Really, perfect.
Beautiful Deluxe Suite (about 1300 sq ft with 1 1/2 baths). Every single item was the best available. Great spa and gym with an indoor pool.
Opulent buffet breakfast included. 3rd night free. 3 hours of a car and driver each day included.
The level of service is what is really special. Everyone remembered our names everywhere we went in the hotel. Friendly and eager to please, but not too much.
I've stayed at 6 different Peninsulas and will always choose one if it's an option. They are the best in the world."
13,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Peninsula rolls.....,"Ever since the esteem proprietors of this monumental achievement opposite Hong Kong island decided to have their guests chauffeured in Rolls Royces, the Hotel kept in pace with this classic brand.

The Peninsula is hardly recognisable from its original plan, nor is its fleet currently consisting of bespoke limousines.

Service and hospitality have remained old school though.

A most memorable stay, Thank you all."
14,Date of stay: November 2015,40,High Tea at The Peninsula,"On the bucket list for every visitor to Hong Kong surely is a sit down to high tea at The Peninsula. Be prepared that if you are not staying here as a guest, there is a queue (shock horror) which starts at 1pm for 2pm seating.
At about HKD638 for two persons and with three of us enjoying this dining experoence, it cost about hkd1200. Was it worth it? Yes for the ambience with its vaulted soaring ceilings, live three piece orchestra playing Mozart, Bach and Chopin, it's a wonderful oasis from the bustling development outside.
Will we be back? No. The milk was off. We had to ask for fresh milk. Tea service was slow. And the offering a little too slanted towards the sweet with more scones than savoury treats."
15,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Superb hotel with outstanding service,Stayed in this hotel for four nights this month. We stayed in a one bedroom suite so there was a bedroom plus a sitting room. It was one of the best hotel experiences we've had. We had the Rolls Royce car pick us up at the airport and arrived to the hotel to be immediately escorted to our room. No need to check in at the lobby. This is a mark of true service. Fresh fruit arrived daily with assortment of flowers. Beautiful indoor pool and a wonderful spa. I cannot recommend this hotel enough. If you are looking for a luxurious stay look no further!!
16,Date of stay: November 2015,40,Very good hotel,"One of the best hotels in the world. Nice rooms, good service. Cannot find anything negative to feedback on this hotel. Love staying in this hotel when I want to have high tea at the lounge as hotel guest are given priority. Highly recommended place."
17,Date of stay: October 2015,20,Couldn't live to our expectations,There is actually nothing majorly wrong with this hotel. We just expected much more considering the big rates they charge for the night. Service was mediocre and definitively not as good as some of the other hotels on the island side - such as Mandarin or Upper House. Restaurant were overpriced and not that special. Location is good though. Doubt i would return though.
18,Date of stay: November 2015,10,Our third visit - STAFF RUNE EVERYTHING,"My friends and I stayed at Pennisula HK on 3/11 - 6/11, room no. 2702 and 1905.
We booked the hotel by using ""American Express"" privileges - complimentary breakfast. while we check-in, none of the staff informed us about the terms & conditions of the privileges which I'd used to booked the room. And then, came to the check-out the staff name MR. TERRY LO was very rude!!!! and showing inappropriate attitude.

1. He was going to charge me for breakfast (which suppose to be complimentary by using American Express card). - Then, I insist not to pay and told him i was privileged by Amex!

2. His reaction is very unprofessional - he turn back on me and gone missing. After awhile he came back with insulting expressions and said ""this will be the last exception"". - I thinking like ""...hello!... I'm using Amex privileges and the terms & conditions mentioned clearly during my time making a room reservation!!!????! what the hell is this? i didn't ask to stay for free!!!

I've been traveled around SEA - this the the first hotel with unprofessional staff, no service mind, very rude and inappropriate attitude. Worst experience ever and will not return

Thank you and best regard to the unprofessional hotel,
Sorayuth"
19,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Magnificent hotel!,"Stayed at the hotel for two nights at the start of a longer trip to Asia, and wow is all I have to say!
Great location on Kowloon peninsula, and easy to get to from the ferry. The hotel offers a glorious lobby. We had a standard room, but there was nothing standard about it- it was spacious and incredibly hi-tech (you could do everything from the tablets, including check your flight status, and automatically close the curtains) tv in tub and speakers in the showers! We arrived late as our flight was delayed, but we were greeted by very professional and helpful staff, as well as delicious green tea turndown service. We did get room service for dinner as the restaurants were closed by the time we arrived, it was the one element of the hotel that was not spectacular.
We had the buffet breakfast the next morning- it is not to be missed! Hundreds of options including Asian and international foods.
While we did not use the pool, we did walk around the facilities (pool, spa, so deck) and all looked incredible.
If you have the chance to check out salon de Ning in the basement- we loved it, it has a really cool vibe.
All in all, this is the place to stay in Hong Kong, obviously pricey, but money well spent!"
20,Date of stay: October 2015,50,I cannot rave high enough about our experience at the Peninsula,"This hotel is first rate in every aspect!

Every amenity was superb. The hotel was impeccable, the service outstanding.

the staff bent over backwards to assist us in every way.

there are few hotels that can boast the features that were offered by this hotel. One great feature was a phone that offered free international calls! I could call the states unlimitedly.This was a great perk!

The food was delicious, and ample (especially the breakfast buffet in the morning)

This is the place to stay in Hong Kong."
21,Date of stay: September 2015,50,"Amazing hotel, super staff and services!","Stayed a few nights at the Peninsula with family at the Deluxe room. Every experience, every touch point was excellent.

My wife felt unwell on one of the nights and we had 3 people including an on-duty nurse, the receptionist who had checked us in and another staff member at our room within 5 minutes.

What I also liked was that in spite of being a luxury hotel, they had an internet enabled phone in the room with which you could call anywhere for free."
22,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Simply Magnificent,"Eventhough it is a hotel from the early 1920's the rooms and hallways are pretty modern. The room has every possible amenity. Nesspresso machine, fully stocked desk with orfice supplies.(even a printer and fax machine) bathroom stocked with Oscar de La Renta amenities. The room is like a space station. Everything is controlled electronically. The food in the main dining room.was delicious. The buffets are grand worth the big bucks that it costs to eat there. Tea time at the lobby is facinating. Service throughout the hotel is very high end. The spa services I received and the Spa itself are top of the line. DOWNSIDE food at room service and by the pool was expensive and flavorless. I recommend skipping small menus and room.service and go out or eat at one of the restaurants.
My star at The Peninsula will be an unforgetable experience. Stayed at room.1912 with a breathtaking view of the harbor."
23,Date of stay: November 2015,50,Worth 7*,"This hotel is pure luxury and something everyone should get to experience at least once in their lives.

We stayed in a Grand Deluxe Kowloon View Room on the 23rd floor. The room was impeccable, everything you could want and more, iPad controls for everything, loved the remote controlled curtains!

We enjoyed afternoon tea in the lobby which was beautiful. The service was faultless, we also had drinks in Salong de Ning one evening, such a stunning bar, the decor is pure class.

The hotel and all that it offers is luxury at its finest. If I could award it 7* I would."
24,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Magical!,"Imagine you wanted to start your honeymoon in true, unrivalled luxury in Hong Kong. Imagine The Peninsula!

Imagine you arrive after a 10 hour flight and as you step off the plane a concierge meets you and asks you to hop on board your club car to be escorted through the airport right up to immigration.....

Imagine that immediately after immigration the concierge is there waiting for you to escort you to baggage reclaim where he collects your bags for you and escorts you to the limousine lounge....

Imagine arriving and not having touched your bags, you take your seat in your chauffeur driven Rolls Royce away from the crowds and are welcomed to Hong Kong by your Peninsula chauffeur who offers you chilled water and your choice of relaxing music whilst you feel like you're floating on air over roads and bridges on a 40 minute ride to Kowloon....

Imagine being personally greeted by the front desk manager who escorts you to your room the minute the Rolls Royce arrives at the door of the absolutely majestic Peninsula, only to find they've complimentary upgraded your room....

Imagine the bay side setting, the grand lobby, ringing with piano and the buzz of visitors and locals enjoying the famous Peninsula Afternoon Tea.....

Imagine the bustle of the city, the unmistakable skyline of Hong Kong Island and everything you need just a few steps from the hotel.....

And imagine after a busy day sightseeing, returning to your room to find complimentary Champagne on ice and handmade chocolates accompanied by a welcome letter from the hotel director, wishing you a pleasant stay....

Imagine your restaurant manager personally recommending the perfect starter, mains and dessert and accompanying wine....all of which being fabulous.....

Then imagine heading to the most comfortable bed from where you don't need to move to open or shut the curtains, turn off the lights, use the phone or browse the hotel directory.....

And finally, imagine all this for less than a night room only, in the Dorchester, London.....

Imagine The Peninsula giving you a dream come true start to your honeymoon and the warmest welcome ever to Hong Kong....

I'm so glad we did....

Unforgettable!"
25,Date of stay: November 2015,50,"There are no words to describe this AMAZING , SPECTACULAR, ELEGANT and BEST in CLASS HOTEL","I am writing this review in my third day out of five nights at the Peninsula Hong Kong. This is my second visit to HK and my second and not last at the Peninsula. Here is the story. There is no nicer place in the world to stay, no higher standards, no better luxury. I have been treated like royalty and I am far from that. I have never seen such service in every category from the front desk, to the concierge, to the food service, the valet , bellman, doormen, housekeepers in the public restrooms
They don't miss a trick. Everything is covered in the highest of standards.
The shopping arcade is fabulous, the tea and chocolate shop delish. The lobby restaurant is so good I ate all
Of my dinners and afternoon tea here. The desserts and pastries at every restaurant are the most amazing delights I have ever had( I have had many) nothing is as good as the chocolates at the Peninsula
The spa is beautiful, warm and luxurious. The views of Victoria Harbor from my room on the 4th floor are stunning even though not high up. The bed is so comfortable the amenities and technology are so spectacular in the room that I never want to leave
There are no words to describe how I feel being here at the Hong Kong Peninsula so do me a favor and make your next stay in Hong Kong at the Peninsula. You will love it in every way, just as I love it and want to return before I have even departed
Do not miss this place. It's one in a million"
26,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Back again - great hotel,"Stayed at this hotel for 2nd time this year. Service is excellent. Spa devine. We loved the breakfast buffet and gym. Also, bar up on the high floor had great view. Very average bar menu but it was late. Stay here if you want to be on Kowloon side and want a luxurious stay."
27,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Style.,Book a room with a view. Such a great hotel classic. Service is fantastic and the room service and restaurants are all worthwhile. Great location. The rooms are well appointed and beds are zzzzz worthy. Some hotels have hype and no game. This one is the game. So good.
28,Date of stay: October 2015,50,One of the best hotels I've ever stayed in,"Stunning hotel with a real sense of history and place. Service is exceptional, great variety of restaurants, and the other facilities are top-notch (e.g., pool, gym). The only downside of The Peninsula is the location in Kowloon, which can make getting to and from Hong Kong island a bit of a pain, especially via taxi after dinner. That said, it does give you pretty much the best views in town."
29,Date of stay: October 2015,50,A remarkable 5 Star experience in ever sense!!!,"With no doubt this hotel has set the standards that all other properties should be measured by. The service, hospitality, professionalism, quality and value make this the finest property I have ever stayed in. 4 nights, complete with Rolls Royce airport transfers created memory's not soon to be forgotten. It is true that the majority of the staff are tenured at over ten years service with a large percentage over twenty years. When you see the interaction of the General Manager, Rainey Chan with the staff, there is no question why all those that I came in contact with are happy, service oriented and provide the utmost in service. Clearly a key to the hotels success is the service culture supported. If you find yourself fortunate enough to travel to Hong Kong, do not consider anywhere else to stay except the Peninsula!!"
30,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Amazing experience,"One of my top three hotels in the world. It is a good example of what it is called ""Asiatic luxury"". Lots of service, the finest details, perfect rooms... The spa is definitively my best ever!!! Even the sauna has views. Not to mention the swimming pool with stunning views over the Kowloon Bay. Everything was luxurious in a simple way."
31,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Undoubtedly amongst the Best Hotels in the World,"The Peninsula Hotel in Hk , or as the well travelled guests call it affectionately , The Grand Lady might be over 100 years old but it manages to retain its Victorian allure plus ALL of the most modern features of a highly efficient and updated hotel. There is an option of staying in the original building or in the relatively new tower which has a breathtaking view of the HK harbour from the Kowloon side. What makes however The Peninsula unique is the impecable service in all levels by all the staff plus large super confortable rooms plus SEVEN of the best restaurants in town offering what even the best gourmand demands . Having tea in the main lobby while chamber music is played by a first class live quartet is an experience not to missed whether you stay at the Hotel or not . Also not to be missed is the Felix Bar on the 26th floor with probably one of the most breathtaking view of the harbour plus a surprise in the mens bathroom !!!!!
Don't miss it."
32,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Classic & chic,"Everything about this hotel is great, rooms are splendid and have an amazing and clever control device that allows you to select your tv channel, turn on the lights, open the curtains, order food, call the reception and so on.... Rooms are very classic, nothing fancy, but high quality materials that makes you feel good and at home. However, I would have loved a door between the dressing room and the bedroom in the suite room to avoid waking up madame when you get dressed up early morning and she is still sleeping. Service is very very good but could still be improved if I compare to Ritz Carlton HK for instance. Swimming pool area is breathtaking, and the overall experience is great."
33,Date of stay: October 2015,40,TOP NOTCH,"This is one of those lovely old iconic hotels with lots of history, lovingly restored and excellently maintained.
The location is very convenient for those who love the hustle and bustle of HK. There are lots of train stations, shops and eateries in the vicinity. It is opposite the HK Museum of Art and a short walk from the harbour. To get here from the airport, I simply took the airport express train to Kowloon station and then hopped onto a cab to reach the hotel in about 10 minutes.
The hotel lobby area is perpetually full of people because the restaurant there is apparently a very popular dining spot even for people who do not stay here.
Once out of the lobby, it was fabulous to retreat to the luxurious seclusion of our room. I am a very finicky person who gets put off by things like grout or stains in the tiles and I would say that our room was really top notch in terms of quality finishings, everything being well-maintained, clean and new and superb attention to detail. There are many amenities in the room which contributed to our enjoyment of our stay here, such as complimentary daily provision of fruits, a valet box in which you discreetly receive your newspapers and put things like your shoes for cleaning and the laundry, numerous ipad-like devices to control the temperature, lighting, music, tv etc; a nail dryer (!!!), 2 vanity counters in the bathroom and a very stylish looking TV at the foot of the bath tub.
We took a dip in the swimming pool which is an indoor one - I felt that it would have been better if it was more heated, especially the jacuzzis - but we had a fabulous view of the harbour, and it was quiet and relaxing, far from the madding crowd.
We dined at Felix which was a nice high-end restaurant serving Western food, (though the inclusion of venetian blinds at the windows that obscured our otherwise lovely view of the harbour was rather perplexing). We had drinks and danced the night away at the cosy Salon de Ning lounge bar.
I must compliment the housekeeping service which was excellent. Service generally in the hotel was above average, the staff being professional and polite.
I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who appreciates understated luxury with very modern amenities in a classic refurnished grand dame."
34,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Flight of fantasy,"We have visited Hong Kong on many occasions, and love this extremely grand, imposing old hotel. For a special birthday treat, and a great surprise, my family organised afternoon tea ( book or queue for ages) in the grand reception, followed by a dramatic helicopter flight from the roof of this iconic hotel. We were escorted like royalty to a special lift that took us straight to the top floor where we enjoyed champagne in the luxury pre flight room, with panoramic views of HK harbour, before again being escorted to meet out charming pilot on the roof and the incredible flight. A definite must !!"
35,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Exquisite in every way!,"We are total fans of the Peninsula Hotels! We were picked up at the airport by their Rolls Royce...a total surprise! Perhaps because we arrived from their Shanghai hotel. The lobby is beautiful and our room was fabulous, 2413, with a right on view of Victoria Harbor. At night we enjoyed a light show with a complimentary bottle of very nice champagne. Tea in the lobby was simply the best! All in all a totally fab experience. Highly recommend. Also be sure to check out their magnificent indoor pool."
36,Date of stay: October 2015,40,Garden Suite Event,"Always grand and always classy, The Peninsula Hong Kong always impresses, even it is for a brief social function - this time at the Garden Suite. Beautiful views across to Hong Kong island. Service in all public areas of the hotel were great."
37,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Long weekend,"Great venue for a friends 50th - completely over the top but stylish.Service exceptional.
Great food with a wide choice and afternoon tea in the foyer is an obvious attraction. Relaxing spa and pool with a great outside area overlooking Hong Kong. Only disturbed by the helicopter taking off from the top of the building!!"
38,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Just perfect,"We have been many times to Hong Kong and have always wanted to stay in the Peninsula but knew it was expensive. All I have to say is it was worth every penny for the experience. We had a fabulous room in the tower, deluxe harbour view. What a view, slap bang overlooking the main part of the harbour over to Hong Kong Island. The room itself was beautiful, furniture, bathroom and a really comfortable bed. One of our nights was the 1st October so we a a birds eye view of the fantastic fireworks. The staff were so lovely and couldn't have been more helpful. All in all a wonderful stay."
39,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Amazing hotel...worth staying forever,Stayed here after 10 years on our 2 nd visit to HongKong.The level of impeccable hospitality is the same.The most amazing thing was they had all the records of our last visit too.The rooms are beautiful with all electronic gadgets at your disposal.Our room no was 2401.will definitely stay again at the P.
40,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Best views,"If you visit Hong Kong, you MUST try The Peninsula. Staff will look down on you, if you don't match their guest's ""profile"", which can be a little annoying, but you don't have to dress up to visit Mong Kok just because a bell-boy expect's you to do it, do you?

If you like ice-creams, don't miss the vanilla. ¡It's worth the trip!"
41,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Another perfect stay,"We stay in the Peninsula every time we visit HK. No trip to HK is complete without at least a night here! The service is sublime, the environment an oasis of calm gentility in a very busy city. The rooms are just wonderful - cool, comfortable and luxurious."
42,Date of stay: October 2015,40,Very busy hotel with the most technologically advanced rooms,"I've always loved the Hong Kong Peninsula! Through the years, I deviated away from the madness of TST to the slightly more civilised central area. This time around, I decided to once again revisit the Peninsula.

I availed of airport transfers and was welcomed by an airport representative upon disembarking the plane. I was then escorted through immigration and was offered assistance with my luggage before proceeding to a dedicated limousine lounge where a stunning Rolls Royce Phantom whisked me to the hotel. Off to a great start, although the airport representative wasn't overly friendly. All she said the whole time was, ""welcome to Hong Kong"" and ""Ill see you on the other side of immigration"" I also wasn't too comfortable having a lady assist me with my luggage so I ended up doing it myself.

Once I entered the grand lobby of the Peninsula, as expected, tourists, guests and diners lining up around the lobby for the afternoon tea service can be seen hovering around. It was crazy! Fortunately, I breezed through the crowd and went straight to my room where they conducted the check-in formalities. Welcome tea arrived quite late.

The room is beautiful and it has remained one of the most technologically-advanced hotel rooms there is. Everything can be controlled through the 3 main tablets located on either side of the bed and one on the desk; from the curtains, lights, room temperature, room service and even ordering 3D glasses or a bucket of ice and all the while making free international calls anywhere in the world! The bathroom has its own waterproof control panels as well located by the sinks and by the bathtub! With a single touch of a screen, you can convert your bathroom into a spa complete with dim lighting and relaxing music.

The service was generally good, although I was disappointed that my request for a 1PM late check out was declined. I do not usually have any problem with this request with other hotels.

So I rate it a solid 4 stars. I couldn't rate it a 5 as it wasn't perfection. The service I wouldn't say was outstanding, at least it wasn't as good as what it used to be. The breakfast in the Verandah was average. Also, perhaps because of old age but the crowd is starting to bother me. The pool, as beautiful as it is, overlooking Victoria Harbour wasn't a very relaxing place with kids constantly running around. If it isn't for the rooms with its majestic views of the harbour, I do not think I would be returning to this hotel.

Location is great as TST station is just across the road road and you are two stops away from Central. HK's biggest shopping centre, Harbour City is about a 50-min walk and so is the star ferry terminal."
43,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Continues to be at the top of their game,"Just finished a four day stay at the Peninsula and it was indeed impressive. Having grown up in Hong Kong and now returning as a ""visitor"", I was hoping that the hotel would remain the same as I had remembered growing up and waiting in line for their lobby afternoon tea. From the Rolls Royce pick up service at the hotel to the in-room check-in to all the hotel staff (both restaurant, front desk, housekeeping), everybody has been extremely attentive and service impeccable. We tried four different restaurants at the hotel and although the food is good, it was the service the outshone it all. Yes, the line for their lobby afternoon tea is just as long. The suites are very well appointed and the bed sheets and mattress are some of the most comfortable that I have ever slept on. I need to find out what brand of bed sheets do they use so that I can buy them to use at home. I usually stay at home every time I visit, but now I will find every excuse to stay at the Peninsula instead. It might be near impossible to score their mooncakes from Spring Moon, but my stay was the consolation prize."
44,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Best of all,"We had a very good Meeting here an we loved to be in HK again,sorry its not longer englisch.Service is as ever best we know and the kitchen does everything you want.sure we will be back again with our companie!"
45,Date of stay: September 2015,10,Unwelcoming,You do hear a lot about cases where Chinese looking guests get bad treatments in HK but I always thought its exaggerated until I faced the same profiling during my first family vacation in peninsula. I am a ABC and they still insist on talking in mandarin to me despite my US passport etc. I requested an early check in which was rudely declined. Had to wait for hours in the lobby and no one cared about us despite paying prime rates. We felt like second class citizens and I will never return!
46,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Unchanged - Magnificent,"Stayed at the a Peninsula for three days last week!

The finest of service from beginning to end. Met at the gate from my flight from London, handed over to the driver - Rolls Royce transfer to hotel. Met at the door - directly to the room. All within an hour of arrival.

Restaurants are designed to impress and so they do!!

Bar on the restaurant level and Felix - excellent - but ask to be sat downstairs at Felix cos the bar stools are not so kind to those with a wider backside.

Used the business centre for the first time which was super efficient.

Wifi excellent in all areas.

Concierge very knowledgeable. A great help.

Check out very efficient.

Hong Kong's finest!!!"
47,Date of stay: October 2015,50,Always wonderful,"My daughter and I stayed for 7 nights
The room was large and the bath room was lovely and roomy .
The beds were super comfortable .
The service was top notch , we never had to wait to be seated .
We went to Felix there top notch restaurant , the food was great ,"
48,Date of stay: November 2014,50,A True 'Grand Old Lady',"A sublime, iconic experience; Sunday afternoon tea at the Grand Old Lady, sitting under the neo-classical arches of the Peninsula Hotel’s Lobby as The Lobby Strings quartet played, and people-watching became a form of moving art appreciation, an experience a notch beyond the norm. (The Japanese used her as its HQ during the Second World War, the Governor, Sir Mark Young, imprisoned in a suite for two months). Tradition is said to be opposite to innovation. For the Peninsula, however, it has constructed its niche based on harnessing its tradition with innovation, thereby not only surviving but also flourishing. The Grand Old Lady has long recognised that tradition is the name given to those cultural features that, in situations of change, are to be continued to be handed on, thought about, preserved, and not lost. The recognition has paid a handsome dividend, and long may such self-investment continue. A privileged experience."
49,Date of stay: April 2015,30,FAR TOO ARROGANT,"We had to wait in line for an hour and a half for a very mediocre tea. You would have thought they were doing you a favour by seating you. the service was dismissive, wont be going back again.We had spent a week at peninsula in tokyo and would never have been treated like this."
50,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Brilliant hospitality !!,"I have heard about this Hotel earlier and stayed during my recent visit to Hong Kong. The hotel is not very modern but has a distinct characteristics .
Lobby : Neatly designed and bustles with activity throughout the stay.
Rooms: are well deigned . I personally liked the Valet box and automation system.
Food and beverage: Lobby cafe and rooftop bar is very good.
Service; Excellent team of associates ."
51,Date of stay: September 2015,50,every detail covered.....,"The Peninsula in Hong kong is lovely.Every detail is thought through - even a nail dryer in the rooms. The views from our room were spectacular, food great. Expensive but as a luxurious treat, worthwhile"
52,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Lost its character,"Having first stayed here in 2007 and awestruck by the experience, I have held this hotel up as my absolute number one ever since. I was very excited to return this year and although a stay here is still a 5 star experience, no doubt about it, it has definitely lost something and been aimed at the corporate market at the expense of other guests which is disappointing.

Gone is the beautiful decor, the rich blues are now a boring beige. The rooms, rather than the previous relaxing haven, are now an overdose on technology with no less than three control pads plus digital switches everywhere. It felt a bit like being in the office, especially when I opened the desk drawer and found a full stationery cupboard complete with highlighter pens and stapler! Good if you're there on business I suppose...

Efficiency is the order of the day and that was appreciated but it was very impersonal. We returned to Raffles in Singapore on this very trip and were welcomed 'home' like old friends but here our return visit wasn't even acknowledged. Our only friendly encounters with staff during our 5 days were with the pool staff and with Michael and Gary at the concierge desk who were excellent. I can thoroughly recommend the horse racing tour to Happy Valley, a fab night out!

Felix was less good and much more expensive than before but it was still a good experience and I would recommend it despite the high prices, although book in advance. Days in advance. It is very popular. Expect to pay in the region of £200 for dinner for two unless you dine early.

A much quieter and less formal alternative is to eat poolside overlooking the harbour. The pool is open until 9pm so you will still have the opportunity to see the harbour light show at 8pm.

The one area that has improved since our last trip is the Rolls Royce transfer. You are now collected directly from the air bridge and whisked through the airport - worth every penny! The forecourt of the hotel is frenetic though so be prepared and be careful not to get run over when coming and going on foot - there is no pedestrian walkway.

Finally we had one very strange experience when a member of staff dressed in a business suit knocked on the door on our last afternoon. We were in the middle of packing and he asked if he could come in but wouldn't say why. He stood stationary in the middle of the room for a few minutes before leaving but I insisted on knowing what he wanted. Eventually he said it was just a regular room check but really? I have never encountered this before and I've stayed in many top hotels. All very bizarre.

I still love Hong Kong and I still love this hotel but please please don't take any more of its character away. We want to know we are in the Orient when staying here and we want the hotel's tradition and history to be evident and displayed proudly, not camouflaged with a layer of corporate generality."
53,Date of stay: October 2014,30,Mixed feelings,"This is a long overdue review that dates back to September, 2014.

Our summer last year was pretty rough so, when we decided to travel to Hong Kong, we made it clear we wanted to stay in a top property that would allow us to truly enjoy our vacation there. After some thought, we opted for the Peninsula due to its iconic status in the city as well as its Kowloon location, since we thought the island, where other high-end properties are located, would be too hectic for us. While the hotel is superb, the experience was not fully what we expected it to be. So, I'll do my best to give props where due, but also be honest where the mark was missed.

I’ll start with the positives: as I said above, the hotel is pretty much a landmark, it dates back to 1928 and, even though it has been partially engulfed by the city’s frantic development, staying here is quite an experience. Both the hotel façade, as well as the different halls, stairs and corridors are undoubtedly elegant and classy. Even though I am not a fan of hotel arcades, the various shops are also worth a look.

Location is also exceptional. While the hotel can no longer boast a harbor location (a considerable portion of land was gained in order to make room for the Museum of Contemporary Art and the waterfront), it is smack in the center of Kowloon, with the quintessential hustle-and-bustle that is a constant feature in the city, and also with a more local flavor as opposed to the likes of Admiralty or the financial area. Several excellent restaurants, shops (both modern and traditional) as well as a considerable amount of attractions can be found in the area, and the rest of the city is easily accessible by underground; in fact, the Tsim Sha Tsui station is located right next to the hotel. Outdoorsy types might also like the hotel location for running and other activities since, as I wrote, the pedestrian waterfront is just steps away.

Rooms (we stayed at a deluxe room) are very spacious (approximately 40 square meters) and soberly albeit tastefully decorated in ocre and sand tones, perfectly combined with various pieces of furniture in shiny black wood. Beds are very comfortable and the whole room is easily controlled by using several iPads that are stocked around the place. Walk-in closets are provided so there is plenty of room for the guests’ luggage, and the bathrooms are huge and well-stocked with all mod cons.

As regards the hotel facilities, the swimming pool and sun deck are quite an experience, with virtually the whole pool to oneself depending on the hour and sweeping views of the city’s magnificent skyline. The gym boasts modern equipment but it feels a little bit cramped. Locker facilities are superb as well, and the fitness center staff is very nice albeit with a basic knowledge of English in some cases.

Breakfast at The Verandah buffet was also to die for, with many options to choose from, mostly local, a great way to start the day with a culinary experience. Likewise, drinks at the bar were expertly prepared by the super-nice and professional staff, and that was an optimal option to call it a day after a busy day of sightseeing. The atmosphere at The Bar, with a mixture of local and international patrons and musicians, was also quite intriguing.

So, why the lukewarm review? Here are a few reasons why we didn’t find our Peninsula experience to live up to the (admittedly, very high) expectations:

-Even if early check-ins are only available upon request and subject to availability, we had to wait forever to be shown to our room even if we arrived in Hong Kong just some minutes prior to standard check-in time. Not that it bothered us much (we were on vacation after all), but that was the first indication that the hotel was at full capacity and the staff a bit overwhelmed.

-We were initially assigned a room that featured a connecting door to the one next to us. While I am usually fazed by such rooms, I must admit I didn’t have second thoughts about the one that was given to us when we arrived at the hotel. Well, I should have, since we found it nearly impossible to sleep due to the noises that guests at the adjoining room were making: loud TV, never-ending arguments in Chinese, phone calls, you name it. I finally had to call the concierge at nearly 5 am and they immediately sent someone to take a look and, apparently, shoosh the noise-making guests. Or so we thought since, after they had left the room a few hours later (at around 7:30 am), their perfectly audible alarm clock kept going off every three minutes or so, making it impossible to sleep once again. I am positive they did it on purpose due to our complaints

Finally, the hotel finally sent someone to our room so that he could see that we were not making anything up. They immediately switched off the connecting room’s alarm clock and expressed a sincere apology and admitted that the door was acoustically inefficient. No further indication was given to us so we went for a walk around Kowloon.

When we came back to our room a few hours later, we found out it had not been made up!! Not that it was a mess, but that is quite a shocking sight at a supposedly top luxury hotel. We immediately called housekeeping and the very pleasant cleaning lady informed us that she had been instructed not to service the room because we were being moved to another, non-connecting room. That is, we had to find out through housekeeping that we were being transferred somewhere else; of course, we had to take care of the luggage ourselves (the cleaning lady offered to carry the luggage herself but it was simply too heavy for her and that would have been rude on our part) and that added up to the surreal first-night experience. At least our new room, just a few doors away, was not a connecting one!

That evening, upon returning to our new room, we found an apology note and a box of candy. A nice gesture to partially make up for a sleepless night. We had no further noise-related issues.

-As I said, breakfast at The Verandah was of superb quality. Nevertheless, various days we had to wait a considerable amount of time to be seated, which is bizarre given the area is not particularly small. And by “ a considerable amount of time”, I mean 15+ minutes. Also, the staff was nice but they gave the impression of being overwhelmed, sometimes forgetting the orders, and other times being openly told off by their supervisors (!). I don’t know if the problem was understaffing or simply several bad days at the office in a row, but it certainly felt weird to us.

-The afternoon tea is another iconic experience at the Peninsula. We did not take part in it but were under the impression that it has become TOO popular. In fact, guests can find themselves tangled up in unwanted queues, ignored by the staff (even desk staff) or slaloming their way through the lobby simply to access their rooms. I understand the whole thing is a Peninsula trademark but I can’t help feeling it should be a little bit more organized in order to manage the crowds, avoid annoying guests that do not wish to experience the afternoon tea and, overall, prevent the whole thing from becoming a bit of a circus.

Incidentally, the lobby was also a bit of a mess at another Peninsula we stayed in (Peninsula Chicago), so that might be a trademark after all 

-Finally, the hotel entrance is certainly spectacular for cars, and used by some guests to show off their wealth by flashing their high-end vehicles, but it is not comfortable for guests that reach the hotel on foot, since there is virtually no space for pedestrians.

So, all in all, while this is a great hotel, I can’t help feeling a bit disappointed at the way it is being currently run. Granted, they had a full house virtually throughout our stay (seven nights) but I was left with the impression that the staff, with the exception of The Bar (not the Felix Bar with its “too cool for you” crowd, which we didn’t like) and housekeeping, was overwhelmed and sometimes struggling to cope with the high amount of clients.

In short,we found the hotel’s attitude towards clients to be reactive, rather than proactive. And that while can be excusable sometimes, it is certainly not what one expects from high-end, iconic properties such as The Hong Kong Peninsula."
54,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Perfect Perfect Perfect,This is a great hotel in a great location. I was so sad we only stayed for 2 nights. Our room was in the older part of the hotel - not very large but beautifully appointed. The breakfast buffet was wonderful. We also had dinner in Felix - they make the best kumquat martini! Our meal was delicious as well. We will definitely stay here when we return to Hong Kong!
55,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Probably the best hotel in the world,"As soon as we landed at Hong Kong airport and were greeted by the wonderful Winnie who was waiting at the gate we knew we were going to have an amazing experience.

Winnie took away any concerns around arriving in an airport in another country, she took our hand luggage and guided us through immigration before taking us to collect our hold luggage. We were then taken to meet Alan who took us to the hotel in one of the hotels superb rolls royces. The car was spectacular and Alan was the perfect driver highlighting points of interest along the way and sharing his knowledge of Hong Kong’s history.

Arriving at the Peninsula it’s easy to see why people fall in love with it’s classic style and amazing service, the hotel is absolutely immaculate and everyone we spoke to went the extra mile to ensure we had the best possible weekend in Hong Kong. The rooms are spectacular, everything is automated and controlled by a combination of tablets and touch panels along every wall including the toilet and bathtub!

On our second day we intended to go to Shenzhen and unfortunately I don’t recall the mans name however one of the staff helped us by escorting us about 200m outside of the hotel to the bureau de change that had the best rate for our currency to change to Renminbi.

The breakfast is amazing and every option is of the highest quality - I was particularly impressed with the cold udon noodle and japanese poached egg. The staff were superb each morning and attended to every need.

We also have to mention Michael the concierge who not only managed to obtain a table for high tea whilst there were about 50 people waiting and he also helped to determine our dinner plans for the evening with the minimum of effort on our part.

I also have to make reference to the pool and gym, the former is a spectacular, indoor heated pool that is perfect for relaxing after a hard days shopping. There is also a terrace just outside from which you have the best views of the hong kong island skyline - perfect any time of day. The gym had the latest equipment and the treadmills had the same views as the terrace making a workout just that little bit more bearable! The sauna and steam room were excellent and there was also the option of a jacuzzi or freezing cold bath to ensure that you felt ready to take on the amazing city that is Hong Kong.

I’ll definitely be back for more!"
56,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Cool Place,"I ate at the Peninsula 40 years ago and wanted to go back. This hotel is expensive. 1 am not wealthy. Got a good room suite , actually. Feasible by planning , asking for a particular type of room, and looking for a price on line.

This hotel was and is worth the trouble. High tech.room to afternoon tea was that most elusive quality , fun."
57,Date of stay: September 2015,50,The Hongkong classic !,"A true first class hotel with superb staff and a place with a lot of history , thanks to the owning family and a long tradition of well trained and passionate hospitality professionals, lots of them with Swiss origins and backgrounds.
It has been and remains a classic, this grand old dame !"
58,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Devine peninsula,"Unbelievable experience! Got the most fabulous upgrade thankyou peninsula! You have spoiled us rotten. Nothing to fault. All other 5 stars we have stayed in do not hold a candle to your grandeur and grace. Staff faultless, high tea was amazing too. We would return in a heartbeat. Treat yourself to the roller experience too. 4 amazing days."
59,Date of stay: August 2015,40,Grand old dame of Hong Kong,"Although the original facade of the Peninsula remains, the scyscraper behind it belies the total modernization and efficiency of the Peninsula.

Staff are courteous and accommodating to a tee. The rooms are high tech and well designed. The view over the bay is spectacular by day and the night shows are fun as well.

The obvious critique is that the Hotel Lobby has become a tourist attraction in itself and it becomes tiresome to walk into what one would expect to be quiet elegance, but find oneself confronted with loud rabbles of tourists and sightseers all the time.

This is definitely a place to be seen - and the rolls royces parked outside add to the bling image."
60,Date of stay: August 2015,50,They Have Thought of Everything!,"They have thought of everything at The Peninsula, Hong Kong. This is a first class hotel and staying here was a great experience. The staff are thoroughly professional and without exception were efficient, gracious and helpful. The Rolls Royce pick up at the airport was ‘glamorous’ and worth the additional cost. On arrival, we were immediately taken to our room where we checked in. The view across the water to Hong Kong Island was impressive (it is easy to get there on the Star ferry). The room was meticulously planned and very high-tech. It was well maintained and so discretely serviced we never encountered staff in our room nor the corridor. Breakfast was varied and of a high standard. The pool area was relaxing but not designed for the serious swimmer, whilst our Spa treatment was enjoyable. I was continually impressed and would definitely recommend this hotel without reservation. Congratulations to everyone there. My only disappointment was the Afternoon Tea. It is served in the lobby area and with it being a tourist attraction you have people queuing alongside where you are dining (as a guest at the hotel you do not have to queue). Whilst the service was polite and attentive, the tea was not replenished and the food portions sparse. I have had a lot of afternoon tea experiences in London and this one was not worthy of a hotel of this quality."
61,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Wow - Worth every penny,"Best Hotel experience. You are pampered from the moment you check in. Stayed for 7 nights on a family holiday with two young university children. They gave us adjoining rooms with a spectacular harbour view. Everything was perfect, and beyond expectations. On the last night my son, went out to meet his friends and were drinking heavily. He had forgotten his room key and my daughter notified the front desk. When he arrived very late at the front desk ( very drunk and covered in vomit) they treated him with great respect and escorted him to his room. I guess they wanted to make sure he found his way to the correct room and did not alarm or disturb any other guests. This is a spectacular hotel."
62,Date of stay: September 2015,50,Perfect Peninsula Staycation,"Having lived in Hong Kong for 7 years and always admired the Peninsular group we finally took a weekend and stayed with them.
From the moment you enter the lobby you realize you are in for something special.
Luckily our room was not ready so they took us in for high tea whilst we waited - I say lucky because I hate queuing and generally that is the only was you can get high tea at the Peninsula when not a guest.
We also received a gift later in the day to apologize for the late room (by the way late was only 45 min after the check in time)
We had a harbor view room which was beautiful, large, amazing view, room full of technology that was easy to use and worked well.
All in all a lovely easy stay.
Highly recommended"
63,Date of stay: September 2015,20,Hotel for billionaires only,"Certainly the property is gorgeous but it neglects basic details even 4-star hotels such as Hyatt Regency would cover. For example, no mineral water in the room. Really? After paying more than US$500 a night they can't even provide a few bottles of water? Maybe they should charge for soap and shampoo too, even though I have regarded soap, shampoo, water, etc. to be part of the room rate.

I was also told I can't get a non-smoking room because everyone else apparently specified they wanted a non-smoking room, which incidentally is not guaranteed and based on availability. I challenged the logic of everyone else having already checked in by that time (2:30 pm) and therefore for me not to be able to get a non-smoking room based on availability, after which they took just another 5 mins to reverse their position and told me a non-smoking room is actually available. Blatant lie or a total lack of effort? Even budget hotels try harder than that.

Didn't enjoy my stay, and had a better experience at W, Conrad and Grand Hyatt, all of which provide bottled water and cost just a fraction of the top dollar charged by Peninsula."
64,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Play after work,"We had a great time here. I loved it. The staff were helpful, friendly & efficient but very low profile so we felt relaxed & easy, no pressure & a lot of privacy. The lobby is beautiful, a classic old space with a variety of food options. The room was lovely, a great bathroom, fabulous harbour views and great electronic controls. There is a super spa area where we were encouraged to relax & freshen up before we left for the airport in the evening."
65,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Brilliant!,"The Wife and I stayed here on 20/8, and we had requested for the limousine pick-up from the airport. We were greeted at the aero-bridge by a hotel representative, which was nice. Unfortunately, we had no help going through the rude immigration staff that HK seems to be famous for. After collecting our bags, we were handed over to a gentleman in the Peninsula uniform and escorted to the Rolls Royce. The Wife was thrilled. We wafted along for just under 40mins, before reaching the hotel. Check-in was efficient, although not buttery-smooth as in some other luxury hotels. The lobby was crowded, mostly with guests forming long queues for the High Tea experience. On a Thursday...
The guest room was brilliant, really. We loved the anteroom for luggage and shoes, the design and decor, the size and spacious layout, etc. The iPad style controls for the room was intuitive and simple enough for a 6 year old.
I also loved the bathroom - 2 sinks!
There was a fax machine in the room, and a dressing table with retracting mirror-never seen one of those before!
The bed must have been custom-made since it was wider than a normal ""King-size"" bed, which is great if you have a kid tagging along. There was something about the room that made us just want to stay in....
Finally, a week before arriving in HK, staff from the hotel had emailed me regularly, offering their services and urging me to contact them if I had any requests. In the past one year, I have stayed in The Four Seasons Tokyo, The Goring & The Savoy in London, and several Shangri-La hotels around the world. None of them had e-mailed me in advance, and on the occasion when I had to e-mail them, they seemed to have no knowledge of my impending arrival. I found that very strange, surely someone in the hotels must have known we were coming (our rooms were always ready). And yet, until our stay in The Peninsula, none had even sent a simple greeting or welcome note prior to our arrival.
HK seems to be changing rapidly, and I'm not sure if it's in a good way.
The Peninsula Hotel, on the other hand, is a wonderful Hong Kong institution of yesteryear which has successfully kept itself at the top of it's game. I certainly hope that doesn't change and would be delighted to return to this hotel. It's simply brilliant!"
66,Date of stay: August 2015,50,World class,"This Gand Dame lives up to its name and more

The rooms have every imaginable amenity (even a nail varnish dryer) with amazing harbour views. Staying in to watch the light show at night was worth it

The Veranda restaurant has excellent breakfast and dinner buffets with a wide range of cuisines

Service is impeccable

World class in every way"
67,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Best in Hong Kong,"I have travel to many great hotels but this one is outstanding..their attention to detail, amicable service, superb location make this hotel stand above the rest.. I think the right words to describe ""Grande but yet personal""
You can see the famous Hong kong harbor from here"
68,Date of stay: August 2015,40,An iconic hotel with amazing facilities and average service,"We stayed at the hotel for two nights as a family of three. The building itself was gorgeous, it's hard to think of any other hotels more beautiful than the peninsula Hong Kong. The lobby was gorgeous, however, during the afternoon tea time it would be filled with tourists and therefore became a bit crowded and noisy.

We checked in at around three pm and there were a lot of people. We had to wait for about 10 minutes when someone finally was there to help us check in. No welcome drinks and there were only two sofas and was full so we had to wait without seats. The service was okay, then the staff took us to our room and briefly explained the facilities of the room. We stayed at an Kowloon view room on the 21st floor and the view was nothing special. The room was a bit too small for three people but we still enjoy our stay since the details were really considerate. We could control everything through the pads and was convenient. I often preferred a four seasons hotel but I have to admit the rooms of the peninsula HK was better.

The swimming pool was amazing! It's one of my favorite around the world. Well-decorated and tranquil.

I also love there breakfast. We tried two places: the lobby and the Verandah. Both were nice.

Overall a nice stay and I'll be back."
69,Date of stay: August 2015,50,Amazing!,"This is the most wonderful hotel! It is decorated in classic style and the service is impeccable. It is pricey but worth every penny. It is on the Kowloon side so you have to ferry or subway over to Hong Kong Island, but that is no problem. There are many fine restaurants nearby and also shopping. Stay here!"
70,Date of stay: August 2015,40,Iconic Hotel,"The hotel is iconic, rooms and facilities state of the art and quality of food outstanding. However, probably due to the outstanding reputation of the hotel, there seems to be some risk of complacancy. Atmosphere in lobby very busy and staff at reception/lobby sometimes struggles to manage flow of tourists vs. hotel residents. House keeping at evening not able to amend timing of service (over 3 nights service attempt at 6pm not offering/being able to come back 1-2h later; reception statement: staff is limited and we have to complete the service between 6-8pm). Rolls Royce airport transfer nice, however felt a bit like ""mass-processing"", e.g. arrival at hotel (handover transfer/reception) and plastic wrapped towelettes instead of cloth just not appropriate for a Rolls Royce transfer."
71,Date of stay: February 2015,50,One of The Best 5- Stars in Tsim Sha Tsui.,Very pricy but it is so worth. Great restaurants that offers the best atmosphere for family and business. This is one of rare Orient elegant meets with Modern Luxury hotel. Services is excellent that makes you want to stay.
72,Date of stay: August 2015,50,The best service!!!,"I stayed at the hotel with my mom. When we arrived , check in is very quick. The receptionist took us to the room and show all equipment in room.

The staff told us how to call to our home without any charges. All switch are digital. Many movies to watch without any charges

Welcome fruit and tea are set up in our room.

Location is very good. It is easy to shopping area and MTR.

Service is excellent. Every staffs pay attention to guests.

Breakfast is good quality but not many selection. However, for me it is better to have breakfast than outside.

I love the hotel. Hope to go back again."
73,Date of stay: August 2015,50,BEST HOTEL IN HONG KONG,Stayed there already a couple of times. The Peninsula HK is on the same level as an Adlon in Berlin. Very high service quality level and amazing outstanding rooms. I always enjoy the Rolls-Royce Pick-up. They are sooo friendly in the entire Hotel. I can highly recommend this very luxury location. Experience it!
74,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Fabulous Hotel,"From the moment we were met in the airport for our Rolls Royce transfer to being escorted through the airport on our departure the experience was wonderful.
We had a beautiful room with everything you could desire. We had requested the replacement of the duvet with a blanket when we booked and that was done before our arrival.
Afternoon tea in the Lobby was good and dinner at Felix was outstanding, both food & service.
We particularly appreciated being able to use the pool and changing rooms after we had checked out & were waiting for our transfer to the airport for an evening flight. We put our cabin bags in lockers, & sat by the pool where we were served with water, fruit & gazpacho, all gratis. We could then shower & change before leaving for the airport."
75,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Top Marks!,"Stayed here for a conference during July. Rooms are very well appointed and integrate modern technology with a classic design. Service of course is better than you can imagine. They do warn you at check in to make sure your evening ""guests "" are in the hotel before 22:00 as they check passports from then. Excellent hotel and gets top marks from this very frequent traveler!"
76,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Wonderful stay,"One of the best hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in, grand elegance mixed with cutting edge technology in the rooms.We booked the Rolls Royce transfer as this was the last destination on our holiday, made you feel very special to be greeted at the airport and escorted through. If I venture back to HK or another destination with a Peninsula I will certainly stay there."
77,Date of stay: September 2014,50,"The Peninsula Hong Kong, certainly one of the best hotels in the world","The Peninsula Hong Kong, certainly one of the best hotels in the world
Located in Tsim Sha Tsui, at the southernmost tip of Kowloon, famous for its malls where all the most luxurious brands can be found. Since its opening in 1928, and with no doubt for many more years to come, this place is a must stop for visitors to Hong Kong.
I was lucky enough to be able to enjoy an outstanding night panorama of the lights of Hong Kong Island´s Skyline from one of the Harbor Suite.
There's really nothing you can criticize in this impressing palace which is part of Hong Kong history.
From the minute you arrive until the last second you'll stay, as a guest you'll be pampered with attention and help. For The Peninsula’s staff, customer´s wellness is the most important.
From the kindness of all its workers, to the most sophisticated technical details, this institution provides a quality of service “beyond expectations”. All this has been very well thought through by the President of the Company Sir Michael Kadorrie. One example that stands out can be experienced with the bathroom phones, which are specially designed to filter the water noises and possible echoes providing the user with a normal surrounding to undertake any conversation."
78,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Still On Top!,"We haven't stayed here in about 7 years. We have stayed in total about 5-6 times. This time, we were in HK for pleasure with two children, both under 10 years. So they have renovated the rooms and public spaces in the newer tower. The renovation is beautiful, keeping the Chinese theme but in an updated, contemporary theme. They have made real improvements with technology. The wifi is pretty strong- better than a lot of other 4 diamond hotels. The biggest upgrade would be the electronic tablets they have installed which allow you to do everything from control lighting to order room service. A real plus. The lighting here is also very good- dimmers on almost all switches. There is nothing really equal to the view of the harbor as well. We have stayed across in Central as well at the Four Seasons but I love the view from the Peninsula. Most importantly, the service levels have remained really high. It's one of the reasons we love the Peninsula brand. The staff go above and beyond and operate at a higher standard. The afternoon tea has become so popular though, there are always really long lines so plan accordingly. Spring Moon is also a really great restaurant."
79,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Nicest in the World,"If I were to attempt to create a hotel from scratch, it would probably end up just like this Peninsula. The service, food and location are all remarkable, but the in room technology is what sets this hotel apart from many other 5 star hotels. Each room is equipped with a printer/scanner/fax machine, nail dryer, 3 tablets to control the curtains/television/lighting and anything else you could image, and several other lavish amenities. If I could move in right now I would. Do not consider staying anywhere else in Hong Kong. The hotel was remarkable enough that when my family arrived to our next stop in Bangkok and saw another Peninsula across the river from our first hotel we cancelled after the first night for the opportunity to experience a Peninsula once again."
80,Date of stay: June 2015,50,"Without compare, the best ever","From the moment we were met at the airport on the concourse by a Cathay Pacific staff and shuttled off efficiently to the beautiful green Rolls Royce that awaited us, I knew the Pen had prepared something special for our 25th wedding anniversary. Accompanied by our two kids, my wife and I booked adjoining rooms for two nights. To our pleasant surprise, we discovered that they had booked us on the highest floor overlooking Victoria Harbor, a chilled bottle of Deutz Peninsula champagne awaited, accompanied by a beautiful assortment of gourmet chocolates and hand written anniversary card. Jessica was the staff assigned to oversee our stay. So very courteous and helpful, even arranging a private tour of the chocolate making area of the hotel which delighted the kids to no end. The rooms are the finest I've stayed, the service is impeccable, and should you need your jaw to drop even further, do visit the pool and spa area. This is surely how it must feel to be a Roman god and goddess. To the Peninsula HK and staff, thank you for being the best stay of our lives and for making our 25th wedding anniversary a memory that will last a lifetime."
81,Date of stay: July 2015,40,Legendary Hotel,"I had been there more than 10 years ago and I had the pleasure to comeback this July for a short stay. The experience start at the airport when someone is waiting for you before the custom and take you through the long corridor to the hotel car (of course only if you take the option)
The view on Central from the room is spectacular.
The difference with 10 year ago is that now Peninsula is a worldwide hotel group and also we notice a change of ""clientele"" more asian people than before.... I guess its reflect the swift in economy power."
82,Date of stay: January 2015,50,The Peninsula Hotel,"This is a first class hotel, with first class service, and first class food. Don't let that put you off save up yr penny's and treat yourself. Afternoon tea is a pure delight.
While the Chinese Restaurant is just fabulous and with a wide range to choose from well worth that little extra!!!"
83,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Amazing,"I stayed at the Peninsula , HK with my family . Our experience there was quite outstanding . The service was brilliant and we had more than we needed of everything .
The rooms are spacious and we had a beautiful view of the harbour ! There were so many thoughtful things in the room , such as a range of phone/device chargers , a jogging route map around the hotel , and much more ! The bathroom was also amazing and I thoroughly enjoyed setting my bath to 'spa mode' - very relaxing . Overall I was very pleased with our rooms. The food was delicious . The pool was also great and the service there was fantastic .
It's a beautiful hotel and you can really see why it's one of (if not) the best hotels in HK .
Thank you"
84,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Best Hotel ##1,"Definatly one of the Best hotels i have ever stayed at. very unique and special. rooms are amazing and comfortable. the service is wonderful.. Breakfast is very special.. great cheff. the lobby is beutiful and comfortable. if tou are staying over sunday so it's a must to be at the lobby at 16:00 for the tea ceremony.
Great location on Nathan road, the main road in Kowloon. the Metro station is right outside the hotel and the Ferry to Hong kong side is close by."
85,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Sophisticated and Warm,"We had a 4th floor suite overlooking Victoria Harbor. It took a few days to know what amenities we possessed. The motorized blinds and drapes were obvious but the nail drier and the daily newspaper locations took a little time. Also, the TV in the bath tub! We were inundated with chocolate of all sorts made by the in house Belgian Chocolatier. Felix Pub on the 28th floor will long be remembered; especially the unique lavatory in the restrooms. The concierge folks, who became our instant best friends knew how to direct us everywhere. The pool and spa were located on two different floors and all was pash. The tip of Kowloon location made everything so convenient. With our parting gifts they have convinced us that the Peninsula is still Number 1 in Hong Kong. Amazing!"
86,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Best hotel EVER!!!!,"This place is probably the best hotel I've stayed at in my entire life and I am only 9 years old but when I went I was 7 years old,my whole family agreed.My favourite part was the pool and the food was spectacular, we had two rolls-royces to pick us up from the airport! The rooms were also very good and enjoyable those of you who gave it one star you are defiantly wrong!!! (PS I went on the 22nd of July 2013 not 2015) PPS best hotel ever definitely recommend it!!!"
87,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Peninsula Hong Kong,"Peninsula Hong Kong is a superb hotel. I really enjoy my stay in this hotel, that I consider the best of the city. Why?
- The rooms are modern and spacious with a tablet that allows you to control the lights, TV, Music and curtains
- The property has an amazing view of the city skyline, if you stay from the hong kong island side you would not have this breath-taking views of this hotel
- ALL the staff is wonderful! Extremely helpful and always trying to make your stay memorable.
- The dining options are several and all very classy. I recommend Chesa to eat a delicious fondue, and the afternoon tea of the lobby.
- The swimming pool is great with beautiful views and with an excellent service.
- The whole hotel is really luxurious and you really feel that is THE PLACE TO BE IN HONG KONG!"
88,Date of stay: July 2015,40,Great stay ! Hard to beat the experience !,"We had a great room with the best harbour view , a must btw. All rooms have been refurb end so all electronics etc work seamlessly . Bed and pillows to die for. Rooms need a little warming up many some more magazines and a plant or flower.
The new bar is great for a cocktail, pool and spa just great with a good sun deck.although pool was a bit cold and would suggest they make one of the two jacuzzi by the pool a hot one ! Salon de Ning worth a visit for a night cap but air conditioning is ferocious !, be warned. The menu at the Philip stark restaurant was interesting nothing on it we liked ! The quality of the service is hard to beat together with this being the finest hotel in hotel in hongkong makes it a must to try !"
89,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Model of Perfect,"Great hotel,gorgeous Lobby,the food taste incredibly delicious,must try the buffet tea set,the room is extremely beautiful,with television in the washroom and control everything just by an ipad.
You need to try the Room Serve Breakfast too!Fresh made orange juice or apple juice or tea etc.,you can choose the breakfast size for 1-4 person per room.And for Suite,you can order up to 6 person's size per Suite!"
90,Date of stay: July 2015,50,Amazing Service,"What a treat!! We had heard so much about this hotel and it had so much to live up to. We arrived and we were upgraded to a beautiful suite with a harbour view. The rooms are like small apartments. Tastefully decorated and so comfortable. What took this hotel to another level was the service. We waited for nothing!!! We dined at Fenix restaurant, a spectacular room on the 28th floor and thoroughly enjoyed it."
91,Date of stay: June 2015,10,So disappointed and let down,"It was always our dream to stay here for a special occasion after hearing so much about this beautiful hotel. I decided to save some money and celebrate with my hubby our 4th anniversary. I mentioned this also in my reservation request but either they didn't know about it or could care. The lobby was extremely packed on arrival not very classy, people were queuing for their restaurant I believe but it just looked messy. On arrival, no congratulations for our anniversary and we were treated like any normal traveler in a lower class hotel. No welcome drink, no card or even a small amenity for our anniversary. My hubby still enjoyed the stay very much but I felt differently. I had high expectations for such an expensive place but I was let down. That's not how you treat your fans."
92,Date of stay: July 2015,50,"Excellent service, high-tech, plush accommodations","For our 15-year wedding anniversary, my husband and I booked a trip to Bali which required a one-night layover in Hong Kong going and coming back. After looking at trip advisor reviews, we decided to stay at the Peninsula on the way to Bali and the Four Seasons on the way back. If we had to do it over again, we would stay at the Peninsula both nights. Both hotels are really nice, but overall the Peninsula wins on service and accommodations.

When we checked in, the person who checked us in at the front desk walked us up to our room and explained how to use the electronics throughout the room and asked us if we had any questions before she left. We used the Amex plat benefits for both stays. The Peninsula provided a fruit medley (pear, apple, orange, etc). The Four Seasons provided us with 3 oranges. The Peninsula staff brought up hot tea shortly after we arrived as part of their welcome gift. One great benefit of the Peninsula is you can call anywhere in the world for free from their phones, so we were able to call our children and make a few local calls to friends who were in Hong Kong without incurring any additional costs. We checked with the Four Seasons and they do not offer this benefit. The Peninsula room was beautiful and everything was electronic - the window shades, light switches, ordering room service from an iPad like device, etc. The breakfast buffet spread was amazing. We were so impressed with the accommodations that I was a bit worried that the Peninsula experience would raise our expectations too much for our Bali hotel experience! The great news is that the St. Regis Bali Resort was everything we hoped for and more. Both the Peninsula and the St. Regis raised our overall luxury standard so it was disappointing when the Four Seasons didn't rise to the same standard. Kudos to the Peninsula staff for making our stay in Hong Kong memorable!"
93,Date of stay: June 2015,30,Extremely dissapointing,It has always been my life long dream to stay at the magnificent peninsula hotel the foyer is truly classy the staff are amazing but the standard of the rooms for $800 was a joke we were given a upgrade so I assume we were in a $1000 a night room it was not at all tastfully decorated cream carpet daggy bedspreads daggy couch the bathroom was magnificent and the pool everything is operated by iPad even the curtains I was so dissapointed this was our last night and was surpossed to be the highlight I was devestated as it took me a month to talk my husband into paying this outrageous amount of money for 1 night
94,Date of stay: July 2015,50,The Peninsula HK- Heads and shoulders above the rest!,"On our trip out to HK, I wanted to try out the Grand Dame of the East to contrast it with a stay at one of HK's newer (taller) luxury properties. The Peninsula blew the other hotel far and away out of the water from start to finish and even after check out!

We stayed in the old part of the hotel on the 5th floor overlooking the front. Even though our room was in the oldest part of the building, everything was updated fresh. The automatic controls for everything in the room was impressive... not even the newer Ritz had this feature. The room was impeccable and spacious with a view over the harbor. The high ceilings make the room even more grand.

If you are a guest staying at the hotel, you DO get to bypass the line for high tea in the lobby which is awesome! The high tea was certainly worth it and as a big eater, it was more than enough food for me such that we couldn't resist getting our scones with clotted cream and jam packed for to go.

Our room rate also included breakfast either at the Verandah (buffet) or at the Lobby (a la carte). We chose the Verandah and it was excellent in terms of variety of selection (western and eastern options), as well as service. They have everything from more light european offerings (cheeses, breads, pastries) to more American fare (sausage, bacon, eggs, omelette station) to local offerings (dim sum) and even Japanese style breakfast foods. The bill came to about $100USD for 2pp so that can be a bit steep for many. Glad it was included in our room rate.

We used the fitness center and pool in the morning and it was virtually empty. The facilities were up to date and clean with amenities to keep you comfortable. The men's locker room included a whirlpool and cold dipping pool, a steam room and sauna. The pool area is beautiful in its Romanesque styling and with views over the harbor and the HK skyline.

The Peninsula may be one of the oldest but its legendary through this day for good reason. One of the key things is the staff's professionalism and ability to truly cater to and be hospitable to guests beyond it feeling like it's their job. They seemed to really care about your stay and that makes a big difference. They're proud to be part of the the Peninsula and as they should!

Upon checking out, I let the associate know about my missing earring that I had misplaced somewhere in the room and she was quick to offer assistance in getting housecleaning to do a scan. I've had hotels promise to look for a lost or forgotten item before in my room when I know I left it there, and the Peninsula actually was the first time I felt like they honestly did their best to retrieve the item and make sure I got it back. Later that day, I got an email saying they found my earring and would be shipping it express to my home! Sure enough, I have the tracking number of the package and am expecting to be reunited with my earring soon. With Hong Kong summers practically unbearable, the front desk associate even let us know that even after check out, if we needed to refresh before picking up our stored baggage for the day, we were free to utilize the showers in the fitness center.

The Peninsula Hong Kong is timeless in its class and luxury. It's not gaudy and over the top, doesn't need to try to be showy or trendy. With its long history, the Peninsula is effortless in its execution from top to bottom. Treat yourself to The Peninsula HK for even just one night and it'll make you recalibrate all your future hotel stays as the Peninsula has certainly not just raised the bar, it practically created it. This is one luxury hotel experience actually worth it all. If I ever go back to HK, I will return there for sure and hope to stay at a future Peninsula elsewhere in the world soon."
95,Date of stay: September 2014,50,The Classic Best of the Best in HK,"The Crown Jewel of Hotels, The Pen holds a standard of excellence and customer service that very few others can duplicate. The staff, no matter where you are in the hotel, somehow, magically acknowledge you by name. Clean. Gorgeous and an amazing pool and spa. I was here last for high tea. Lovely string quartet playing in the mezzanine above. Impeccable service. Yummy treats. And go to have a drink or eat at Felix on the top floor. According to my brother, the men will enjoy the men's facilities. Take the car to and from the airport, if you can. A very special place."
96,Date of stay: November 2014,40,Bellweather!,Very stylish with a great history and ambiance. I have visited this hotel many times over the past 40 years and it is a splendid establishment. Unfortunately my last visit was not the best service wise and a little less than I am used to but i will still return again.
97,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Sublime luxury,The service at this hotel is simply the best! Nowhere in the world will you find service like it. The hotel is beautifully elegant and the rooms magnificent. Even if you only stay for one night I urge you to take the opportunity to revel in this beautiful hotel.
98,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Good as it gets,"Umpteen visits later< i got to stay for two nights at the grand old Dame ! What i really enjoyed was the cutting edge of tech blended with the old world charm and grace of good living.
The location is of course excellent, the lobby is historical, whilst not imposing or overly grand. The staff are efficient and attentive. The welcome tea is a pleasant surprise. I loved the fact that the tv muted when the room cordless phone rang!"
99,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Best Hotel in the world,"This hotel is the best hotel i have stayed in, the service the food the location everything its just perfect, this is the only hotel that i feel as home, definitely peninsula hotel is the best hotel in Hong kong and for me the best hotel i haver ever stayed at."
100,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Still the best in Hong Kong,"Rumors of its demise are unfounded. The lobby is definitely the old fashioned, smaller hotel of the past but still elegant. The rooms are totally flawless. Our room was brand new, modern with every electronic amenity, Great gym and awesome pool...when you are doing laps, you can take your breadth on the side with a view of Hong Kong island. Best location in Kowloon...definitely the best place to stay unless you have business on the Island. If you can afford the view of Hong Kong island, it might be the best view in the world."
101,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Perfection,I recently enjoyed a 4 night stay in a one bedroom suite with my daughter while on holidays. Our room had just been done up and had all the mod cons you would expect and more. The extras you received in your room like the free movies were at hit with my daughter. All the staff were amazing and very helpful to ensure we had a wonderful stay. There attention to detail was spot on and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it if your looking for somewhere luxurious to stay in Hong Kong.
102,Date of stay: April 2015,50,"""Don't be fooled""","This may be considered the ""grand old dame"" of HK BUT all I can say it is without a doubt one of the best hotels I have stayed in. We opted for 2 suites interconnecting in the original building and the family were spoilt with space. The suites are incredible and packed with technology as per other reviews. With every suite comes a complimentary LV Mini Cooper for daily use.

The pool, gym and spa is amazing. Spoil yourself and take the Rolls, it just completes the experience. Every staff member was super friendly and efficient.

I rate it one of the best hotels simply because it's location is superb, staff and service impeccable and fab food.

I will definitely NOT stay at any other hotel in HK but the ""Grand Old Dame"""
103,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Excellent and great atmosphere,"We booked the Rolls Royce trip transfer from airport and that was a great experience.
Pick-up from the plane and direct to your room! Check-in inside your room, staffs were very good and professional.
The hotel himself looks may be a bit dated but I thing they wanted to keep the original atmosphere and I do think it's better like that.
The room was good but quite pricy to have the harbour view. But the view was amazing.
As you can imagine, you have all amenities in room, including Nespresso machine and tea, office stationary, sleepers, free wifi etc...
Everything to control is on Ipad in the room and the best was free calls from your room anywhere in the world... a bonus!
The pool is beautiful and it's a shame we didn't stay longer to enjoy it.
The breakfast was one of the best I have seen.
The Salon de Ning had a fantastic ambiance with a great singer group ""Elements of Soul"" just take 10 min to relax before your bed!
The Cantonese restaurant Spring Moon was very disappointing concerning the food(service was good) and very pricy for the quality you get, shame, that was my only bad experience in the hotel but I would definitely recommended to stay here."
104,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Luxe with this tech,"Very comfortable room smelling of luxe and excellent service. Use of technology is one of the best I have ever seen anywhere in the world. The tablets ( 3 of them ) in the room controlling everything from the curtains and the temperature to the Audio / Video and lighting are a hotel guest's dream come true. Free movies and free international calls are fabulous bonuses. Food was pretty good too. Only complaint is the long and disorderly queue at check in and the gawking crowds in the lobby ( the price of being a city icon I guess ) , which creates an annoying and slightly cheesy first impression. However everything afterwards including the room upgrade was very welcome and overall experience was well worth the price . I am taking the Rolls from the airport and doing the helicopter ride next time !"
105,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Perfect Peninsular,The Peninsular in Hong Kong is one of the worlds truly iconic hotels. They do everything right and everything is done by care with amazing professionalism and pride which is unsurpassed anywhere. The Peninsular has a reputation to uphold and the staff take great pride in upholding the grand traditions. When is Hong Kong stay here because you will remember it forever.
106,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Top of the top,"One of the best luxury hotel I tried worlwide. Expensive but it is real luxury, everything is perfect: Food, decoration, service. Spa is unbelivable and location is very good. We have tried the Swiss restaurant was funny to have fondue in Hong Kong :-)"
107,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Hong Kong's Grand Lady.,"We were lucky, and quite excited to stay in The Peninsula for 3 nights. Our flight was met at the gate, and a representative helped us navigate the airport through to the limousine lounge. The Rolls Royce transfer was a peaceful start to the trip. A hotel representative, Jessica, met us as we alighted the car, and showed us to our room. Check in was completed in the room, and we had a first hand explanation of all the hotel had to offer.
The room itself was a newly renovated Deluxe Room and had many modern touches in its classically old school style. The king bed was comfortable, and the down pillows were soft, and lush. The bathroom had lashings of marble, and high ceilings. The bureau hid the amenities like the mini bar, and the safe, and the Nespresso machine. The room controls like lighting, air conditioning and television are managed through one of two tablets available by the bed.
The renovations still keep a lot of the old character of this hotel, but bring it into the modern era with its design and facilities.
A big thank you to the concierge team who helped me when my satchel buckle broke, and many thanks to Joyce in the lobby restaurant who helped us with our sightseeing, and was able to help us get there via public transport. The service in the restaurant was prompt, and observant, as you would expect from The Peninsula. The fresh juice was amazing, my mouth is watering as I recall it.
Housekeeping were friendly, and their daily smiles and greetings gave our days a great start.
My family and I have been coming to Hong Kong since 1981 and we have walked past The Peninsula many times. One day I would stay here I vowed. The day came, and I loved every moment of it. The hotel was grand and venerable, without being alienating. The service was respectful and prompt, and always ready to please.
It must be hard to manage a business so iconic, that it would be impossible to imagine Hong Kong without it.
After this stay, I couldn't picture Hong Kong without the Peninsula either."
108,Date of stay: June 2015,50,Other hotels should learn from them,"The Pen gets just about everything right.

1. Airport pickup. Representative meets you at the gate and escorts you straight to the car. Only waiting is at immigration. Check-in agent meets the car and you go straight to the room.

2. Room technology is current and actually works (!). Free VOIP calls worldwide. In-room fax, copier, printer. Push-button controls for everything via bedside panel. WiFi that actually works, for as many devices as you wish, with minimal hassle.

3. Breakfast in the Veranda (one of HK's top restaurants) or by room service -- this is free with AMEX FHR booking.

4. Discreet and prompt service. Make a booking for tea and ignore the long queue of tourists. Go to the front desk, wait there, and they'll escort you right to the best table (which, for the record, is on the right when facing the hotel, near the window, almost all the way to the back. See without being easily seen.

5. Limited nickel-and-dining. None of the US$12 bottles of water. Whatever we wanted within reason, on-site or via room service, seemed fine on the AMEX FHR program - as opposed to some hotels that restrict to just a continental breakfast. Laundry is insanely expensive, but there's a cleaner on Carnavon Rd about 50 feet off Nathan Rd who did a week's laundry for me for HK$120.

I highly recommend a room with a view of the harbor. It costs a couple hundred US$ extra, but it's one of the best views in the world."
109,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Asia trip,"Stay in a high floor in the towers building and you will be rewarded with the most amazing view ever.Service is flwless and you may call overseas for free from your very room. Lobby may seem a bit too crowded at times, with not so smart dressed people."
110,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Birthday surprise,"Magical surprise!
My big 50! 5 days stay, picked up in a Rolls Royce from the airport, added to my excitement.
The staff are very helpful and friendly, our beautiful room had a harbour view across to Hong Kong Island, great for the laser show at night,
3 iPads to control the lighting, TV and curtains, complimentary fresh fruit everyday! Wonderful breakfast with plenty of choice.
Beautiful swimming pool with steam room and jacuzzi, a must to cool down from the days heat!
Highly recommend the famous high tea with orchestra to listen too while eating delicious cakes and pastries"
111,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Hong Kong's Finest,"The Peninsula Hong Kong, the grand dame of Hong Kong - what a wonderful hotel. I stay here regularly and I'm always pleased with the choice. The hotel exudes luxury, friendliness and comfort - all under one roof.

My reservation was made by American Express under their fine hotels and resorts package. Check in was efficient and I was asked as to my preference of room location. A courtyard room was available and I was escorted to my room for a two night stay. Rooms are well appointed with very modern devices such as iPad controls. The butler box is useful for sending laundry and for the shoe shine service. After check in I took a bath and relaxed for half an hour and then off to meetings. Bathrooms again,well appointed with luxury amenities. And two sourvineer soap gifts to take away. Arrived back around 9.30pm and took a light dinner in the lobby - excellent food.

Breakfast the following morning I took at the Verandah restaurant - buffet style with their usual excellent selection. I love the Japanese style eggs. Great omelettes to! Nice, bright and relaxing - just the place to start the day. No hurry! If the juice you want isn't there or you want a combination - just ask. There is also a full variety of tea or coffee on demand - so feel free to ask. Great selection of pastries as you would expect!

Hotel in close proximity to the Hong Kong Art Museum - so that's always on my agenda. It's an excellent museum and has thought provoking displays. I am regularly impressed with this museum as indeed I am with the hotel.

All rooms have VOIP service which allows you unlimited telephone calls to anywhere in the world. Great idea which allows you to save a few dollars on calls and is appreciated. Good quality connection.

Check out was efficient and my 4pm check out was extended to 5.30pm as per my request. Concierge is super helpful and knowledgeable on Hong Kong matters. It was a great stay and I was sorry to leave."
112,Date of stay: May 2015,50,A bucket list hotel,We had a great experience at the Peninsula and it started at the airport being met at the gate and taken to the hotel in one of their Rolls Royce. The rooms are very modern filled with the latest electronics. While my wife was shopping I spent some time at the Pool and Spa. This was nice and relaxing. The restaurants are amazing in the hotel. This is a hotel to experience at least once in your life.
113,Date of stay: April 2015,40,Great hotel for first time travelers to Hong Kong,"We stayed here 2 nights before embarking on a cruise. We arrived at the hotel at around 9 pm after a 16 hour nonstop flight from Chicago. We were escorted to our harbor view room (beautiful and well worth the cost). On the table were fresh fruit and incredible tea was delivered (without our requesting it) in a few minutes. The room itself was beautiful with dark polished wood everywhere and enough storage space to stay for a month. What really impressed us, though, was the technology: the phone with VoIP that we could use to call anyone in the world, for free; the 3 iPads that we used to work the lights and curtains (with some getting used to) and order room service and change channels on the tv. Service was impeccable for a world class traditional hotel. The location was perfect, close to shopping, expensive shops, museums. Downsides? The restaurants were somewhat of a disappointment, particularly the dim sum restaurant. Our lunch there was awful. Would I stay there again? Absolutely. But I would ear elsewhere."
114,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Exceeded all my expectations,"From the moment we landed in Hong Kong until we checked out to board our cruise ship a few days later, the Peninsula provided the most wonderful service I have ever experienced, exceeding its lofty reputation as one of the leading hotels in the world. Everyone was efficient and pleasant; the room and amenities were outstanding, and the food was excellent. High tea was a highlight, as was the superb live music, day and night. The hotel is a combination of old-world elegance and tradition along with the most up-to-date electronics.
My only regret is that I don't travel to Hong Kong that often.
Our entire experience was just lovely, and we smile whenever we think about it."
115,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Over the top hotel...exceeded put expectations!,"This was put first experience with the Peninsula in Hong Kong and it was even more magnificent than we had been told. Friends suggested the rolls Royce airport pick up and we decided to go for it. We were so happy that we did. The service was way over the top, the bars and restaurants were outstanding and the shops were so great we could have just stayed in the hotel to shop. (Although we did not)."
116,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Best traditional Hotel in Hong Kong,"I visited several times the Peninsula Hotel since I am a resident in Hong Kong but haven't stayed in house for many years . The whole stay was a great experience . The service is still top level even though most HK hotel have seen a drop in the level of service these past years . Well refurbished rooms with great amenities , personalized service and gentle smile makes it a unique experience. The only drawback is the quality of service at the lobby floor lounge which I find average and not in line with the hotel ."
117,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Exceeds even the highest expectations,"From our arrival at Hong Kong airport until our departure from the hotel the level of service at the Peninsula exceeded the level of service we expected.
It was a return visit to the Peninsula and there is no doubt that we will return in the future. We like visiting Hong Kong and our stay at the Peninsula made our stay extremely enjoyable.
Our room was the same as we had stay in previously but it had been renovated. We liked the charm of the old room but the renovated room was equally as good.
We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast in the Verandah Restaurant. It was an experience to see a large cruise boat go past the buildings.
We also thoroughly enjoyed some dining experiences in the Lobby.
Whenever we wanted some assistance it was always forthcoming."
118,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Great Hotel,Great location. Very upscale and clean. Friendly staff. The rooms are great because they are large and super clean. They have an expensive espresso machine in each room. Everything is high tech. You can open and close the curtain from the iPad-ish gadget next to your bed.
119,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Well deserved,"Established for decades in Hong Kong, Hong Kong Peninsula must be one of the most outstanding hotels in the eyes of tourists and the locals. Some people may even think no place compares to it.

It had been my dream to enjoy a meal in one of its restaurants when I was young, and the dream came true. You must not forget the excellent food and service provided in any of its restaurants, in front of the dazzling seaview of the Victoria Harbour in a starry night.

Some may have opinion to the contrary, especially criticism on its expensive price. Nonetheless, please remember every rose must have thorns. I would contend that you need to pay before you can savor the service!

If I have to take a pick on its restaurants, I'll go for Gaddi's. Not only because it charges you most (and therefore the best food, drink and service), but also the impressive environment when you start to enter into the restaurant.

I'm glad I could stay over in the suite twice. Thanks to its regular maintenance and strive for the best, you won't be surprised by its room decoration, bedding and amenities. Staff are always trying to show their sincerity by giving small gifts or snacks every time when we came back again.

I hope you won't find it as an advertisement, yet still I have to say, it must be your once in your lifetime place in Hong Kong."
120,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Celebration holiday,"I have stayed in a few 5 star hotels but there are not enough stars available to rate this hotel. It is simply wonderful. We decided to have a week away to celebrate my 60th birthday with a bit of luxury. Starting with our arrival at the airport we were greeted as we stepped off the plane,guided through the airport arrival process and out to the waiting Rolls Royce for our transfer to the hotel. On arrival we were greeted at the door by Chris and taken directly to our room for check in. Chris explained how all the gadgets operated and presented us with champagne,birthday cake and fresh tea all exquisitely presented. He also explained that we had been upgraded due to the celebration. The room was just beautiful,lovely piono finish on all timber work, iPad control of lights communication etc. Gorgeous marble bathroom with TV, twin vanities and Oscar de La Renta toiletries. Other amenities in the hotel were numerous restaurants, nightclub and bar and the wonderful Lobby where we had breakfast and a couple of lunches. The service was immaculate and staff very competent yet warm and friendly. Getting around Hong Kong is quite easy and we chose the hop on hop off red bus to sight see which gave a great overall view of a great city."
121,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Great Hotel!!,Loved this place! The suite we were given was apartment-like and we could have lived there for a month. Great jacuzzi with a view of the magnificent harbor. Super breakfast buffett with gourmet Western or Eastern selections. Service was impeccable.
122,Date of stay: April 2015,50,better than home!,"This is the ultimate spoil of a hotel...from the airport pickup onwards we were treated like royalty,...nothing was too much to ask and the quality of EVERY ASPECT of this hotel and its service is top notch. I made two difficult requests upon arrival...it was Mother's Day so all restaurants of worth were pretty much booked out...I asked for a top class restaurant for that evening...at about 4 pm! Within 20 minutes we had a booking at a 1 Michelin star rated restaurant nearby which was really good and we had a great night. Then I wanted a manicure the following day...only the best manicure I have ever had ...was organised for me...again very near the hotel...within 20 minutes! The hotel rooms are exquisite, comfortable and so clean...the beds are better than at home...like crawling into a fluffy cloud, the showers are also the best! This hotel is a total spoil and I always love returning and I don't much like leaving!"
123,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Excellent,"Every aspect of the peninsula is top notch. The design of the room is great. Because we had an early flight out of Hong Kong, we ordered room service for breakfast as the hotels restaurants were not open yet. The food arrived at our room precisely on time and was delicious. I was traveling with my one year old son and the hotel gave us great baby amenities for him. I would recommend the peninsula to anyone going to Hong Kong."
124,Date of stay: April 2015,50,The old lady of HK has some new tricks,"Decided to treat my visiting parents, to a surprise night at the Peninsula, after break in Singapore. Right off the plane, we were met by a sign, and electric cart for my Dad, which whisked them away to the luggage and immigration. To see my kids sitting on the back seats waving at us, with Grandparents up front, whilst the wife and I trudged along with everyone else. When we caught up with them at luggage carousel, all the bags had been retrieved, and they took us all out to the waiting chauffer, who took them all in them in the Peninsula green rolls royce phantom to the hotel. The wife and I caught, the airport express, and after a couple hours back home decided to visit my parents, and pick up the kids. They were staying in a room on the 5th floor facing the entrance, which had obviously been remodelled since the time I had stayed here a few years ago.
Everything is now controlled by ipads, which the kids loved, from lights to curtains. A really nice Nexpresso coffee machine, which was a bit strange as water needed to be filled by the hotel, so that you couldn't top up via tap water. Very much of a high ceiling colonial building, with a modern Asian contemporary decor. Large colonial style bathroom. Service as expected was impeccable, though I did find dragging luggage to my car, without any offer of help, when my parents checked out a bit remiss. Breakfast though expensive, had a great variety of choices, both Western and Chinese. , At the end of the day, my parents loved it so much, that they extended their stay to 4 days.
Also the lobby does become a bit like a station with all the tourists gawking, Raffles in Singapore, only allow guests in main part of the hotel, so there's an idea. Not quite perfect, more a 4.5 than a 5."
125,Date of stay: May 2015,50,Exceeds Expectations,"My first time in Hong Kong and fortunate to be steered to THE Peninsula (a legendary standard here). This establishment did not disappoint and in fact exceeded the high expectations I had. While the beautiful decor showed a restrained elegance, the service was exceptional as well as all aspects of the dining experiences to be had- from room service to on site dining .
A colleague had arranged the concierge pick up service from Hong Kong airport which was a terrific welcome to Hong Kong as it whisked us to and through Customs and then through baggage to our hotel car service, at all times discreetly attended by a staff member. My only regret was to not have more time enjoying the many other amenities provided, but I will return . My itinerary in Hong Kong and China this trip involves many different hotels, so I will be curious to see and review the other locations on my trip. If you can, give yourself a very enjoyable and luxurious experience at the Peninsula."
126,Date of stay: May 2015,50,The Penninsula is DEVINE,"This hotel is exceptional. Everything has been thought of,anticipated and it is pure luxury. I have stayed at four seasons HK and even Penninsula NYC - do not compare with this hotel. Cannot wait to return."
127,Date of stay: May 2015,50,"Top-notch in Hong Kong, yes...still","Years ago, the Mainland China used to raise Hong Kong’s Peninsula Hotel as an example to educate the Mainland on the “quality service” and “attention to details”.

I’ve been to the Peninsula many times for other reasons than staying. Yes, the refined ambience from the colonial time has been diluted. Through that extravagant lobby flows the busy traffic of tourists and Mainland shoppers, nouveaux riches or not. However, ultimately it was staying in one of Peninsula’s suites which led me to the final conclusion that this is indeed Hong Kong’s finest hotel. When it comes to the room, I wouldn’t hesitate a fraction of a second to rate Peninsula above Hong Kong’s Ritz, Four Seasons, Mandarin and Shangri-la (haven’t tried the Upper House yet) etc… let alone others. No other modern hotels have that kind of high colonial ceiling and spacious suite, yet this ancient hotel is the most digitalized at the same time (must be upgraded recently)… I literally had a hard time locating a physical button in the room.

The details in the room are well taken care of, better than any other similar-level hotels. The double glazed windows, polished, dust-free furniture, mirrors giving multi-angle views, disabled friendly toilet… the golden five-star list goes on. Even the curtain… the Peninsula should boast the only curtain which blocks the finest string of day light, superb for a fussy sleeper like me but maybe a bit too “caring” for those who normally wait for the sunbeam to give them the morning call.

Now here I might be a bit critical: I did feel that there missed a guest toilet next to the lounge for such a big suite.
And here I should be very critical: I had an incongruously bad experience with the room-service Chinese dinner. It tasted so disappointing that I had been confused for quite a while.
Lastly I am not being critical: compared to the top-notch room, the gym and pool obviously haven’t caught up. The fitness centre faces an unbeatable view of the Victoria Harbour but the facilities are a bit seasoned. I am sure they will get improved very soon.
I will definitely go back to stay in the Peninsula again."
128,Date of stay: April 2015,50,A landmark (with all good and not so good things about it),"The Peninsula is a landmark. Beautiful building at a great location in Kowloon. I can only say good things about the hotel – comfortable rooms, very good breakfast and some of the best service you will find in the world. Also, the room price was pretty reasonable. The only problem is the problem you find @ landmarks – so many rooms, so many guests and so many visitors that it gets crowded. But if you are staying or a couple of days and are looking for a good place in HK this is it."
129,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Truly a five star hotel,"What a pleasurable experience. After a two week trip to China, we ended our travels at the Peninsula Hong Kong. We have stayed in other top tier hotels, but this is at the top of my list. The rooms were wonderfully appointed, with up to the minute, appointments, including an easy to use touchpad controlled lighting/sound/a/c system. I always have trouble applying makeup because the lighting is poor. The Peninsula has a lighted makeup mirror in the room which worked perfectly, not to mention a coffee/cappucino maker. The staff could not be more helpful, the location was very convenient, and you felt wonderfully taken care of."
130,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Amazing Hotel,"We spent 3 nights at the Peninsula and I wish we could have stayed longer. The attention to details by the staff is incredible. They remembered our names at the restaurant and front desk. Whenever we needed something, they were there in minutes. I would agree with the comment about bad coffee; although we found bad coffee throughout China and wouldn't say it was just the Peninsula. The Nespresso machine in the room was a real treat as was the free long distance phone calls. Definitely a 5 start experience.."
131,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Luxury + Comfort + Service = Extraordinary!,"Three days in ultra deluxe paradise feels as restful as a week! My husband and I just returned from three nights at the extraordinary Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong. These days so many places claim to be five stars, but the Peninsula IS truly the real deal!

Special thanks to the Concierge team: Every single aspect of our trip planning with the Peninsula was seamless! Gary at the concierge was extraordinary and help me plan out all kinds of details before I arrived. Once I arrived, Sumi at the concierge helped me carefully plan out a perfect day of exploration around my own. She made me feel so special and like I was a longtime friend. These guys take customer service to an entirely new level! Thank you to all from Ms. Simon. :)

Few tips:
~ When you can't sleep, be sure to order room service and a 3D movie with glasses to enjoy from bed! So much fun!
~ If you can make it to their downstairs bar do! We danced and partied on Saturday night till closing at 2 AM. Be sure to bring your best party dress and everyone there looks fabulous.
~ The breakfast buffet at the Veranda is amazing! We enjoyed breakfast for over an hour every day and it was one of the highlights.
~ If you book a spa appointment, which I highly recommend, be sure to let arrive at least an hour beforehand ideally 1 .5 hours early. There is a very specific reason – you'll be taken to an entirely different area of the hotel reserved only for spa guests. There you will have access to several additional and special spa rooms. That's all I will say because it should be in the surprise!
~ Yes, they cost a lot more money than a taxi, but the thrill of taking a Rolls-Royce to and from the airport was absolutely fabulous! My husband and I had so much fun enjoying this special luxury. So, if you can do it it's worth the experience!
~ Lastly, if you are trying to choose between staying at the Ritz or the Peninsula, I would say usually we love Ritz Carlton hotels, but in this case we were very very happy that we chose the Peninsula. It is so warm and luxurious compared to the very modern energy and architecture of the Ritz. We found this Ritz to be kind of cold and impersonal feeling. That being said, we did enjoy an amazing Italian lunch on the 102 floor there. It's so high up that it make city actually look very small. We do recommend you check it out!
Around town:
~ Be sure to try all the crazy exotic fruit that you see in the market. Some of it is the most delicious I've had anywhere.
~ Don't be afraid to ride the subway! We had a very fun time taking it twice. You can learn a lot about city by at Subway and Hong Kong really wonderful.
~ We really enjoyed visiting Hollywood Street which is filled with ancient antique. It's in a slightly quieter area with lots of extraordinary pieces of art to enjoy."
132,Date of stay: January 2015,40,Great hotel with terrible coffee,"In January i had the pleasure of staying at the Peninsula in a huge grand deluxe harbour view suite on the 20th floor. The room has amazing views with excellent decor as well as a separate side entrance for the porters to deliver and collect baggage directly to and from your dressing room.

The bathroom is like the rest of the suite, large and immaculately presented, with double vanities and marble as far as the eye can see.

The fleet of Rolls Royce's are a nice old world touch and the staff a courteous, respectful and professional.

My only real gripe was the horrible coffees on offer. At $13AUD this particular cappuccino was undoubtedly the most expensive I've ever had and one of the worst. Barely above gutter water.

Other than the poor excuse for coffee it's a great old world hotel with magic views and is close to all that HK has to offer in the way of shopping and the ferrys to get to the peak or over to Macau."
133,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Wonderful!,"My husband had arranged the Peninsula Rolls pick up for me after a crazy long flight from Dallas. They met me at the jet bridge, whisked me away on a golf cart - beating everyone on my flight to passport control - helped me with my luggage, walked me through customs and into the waiting Rolls. That was just the beginning.

The room was comfortable, large and quite luxurious with everything controlled by various tablets, switches and remotes. The vanity had a lighted mirror that appeared at the touch of a button, along with a cleverly hidden hair dryer and even a nail dryer? The marble bathroom had everything you would expect executed luxuriously and tastefully, even if what you expect is a cleverly disguised TV above the bath.

The buffet breakfast was very good. High tea in the main lobby was totally worth it. Don’t be put off by the long line of people waiting for a table. If you are staying at the hotel, you can easily make a reservation and get right in. Have a drink at Felix on the 28th floor; the view is great and the bathroom is a must see.

Most impressive was the staff, everyone we encountered was helpful, professional, eager to assist and always with a smile. Without going into details, I had occasion to work with the housekeeping staff via email when we got home. They were truly exceptional and the Peninsula should be proud to have such a fabulous team working there."
134,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Flawless,"Another memorable stay at the Peninsula. It's expensive, but the arrival service at the airport and Rolls Royce transfer is a great way to arrive. It's not faster than the airport express train, but a stress-free way to start the pampering after a long flight. Suite in the original building left nothing to be desired. Great room service, pool, spa, restaurants. . Lots of technology - pads/screens everywhere for lights, aircon, curtains - and room service ordering. Will be back."
135,Date of stay: April 2015,50,One of my absolute favourite hotels,"Never written a review on tripadvisor but this hotel really deserves mentioning. Absolute perfection from beginning to end. Be sure to book pickup from the airport with the RR to make the experience complete. Dine at Felix, have afternoon tea and dont forget to have breakfast there. Spa treatments are all great. Going to HK? Look no further!"
136,Date of stay: April 2015,50,Feels like home away from home.,"Almost two years of my life have been spent in total staying at this hotel . I have been staying here since 1978 a couple times a year for about a week each visit. I have seen many changes over the years all improvements to maintain the status as one of the Grand Hotels full of tradition and history in the world. What makes this hotel so special is not just the great comfortable rooms ( stay in the old wing for the history feel or the new wing for remarkable comfort and the latest in technology to make you feel there is no need to stay anywhere else), the features of free latest movies selections , the VOIP on your room phone allowing you call anywhere in the world at no charge, the different food bites waiting in your room on your return each evening, all amenities you could possibly want in your bathroom including TV from stations all over the world and radio stations from the web in many languages. Your butler box for newspapers , shoe shine , laundry. Butler service on each floor in your room, tablets on your desk and bedside to operate all controls in your room. A fax machine and a desk with all stationary amenities you may need etc,, it is not the great many restaurants that are some of the best in the world, like Spring Moon for traditional local Chinese, the Japanese restaurant, Gaddi's for superb fine dining since the 20.s , the lobby for high tea every day, the verandah for great views and perfect breakfast and family buffet like nothing you have experienced every Sunday, The Spa that is one of the best if not the best in the world, the huge indoor swimming pool that opens up to a view of the harbor and breakfast in your robe. I could go on. But what I love most are the people working here . No matter what field they provide service in they are the best of the best . Proud to be working here many have been here like me for decades, they make sure to make your stay comfortable and to remember what you like and need when you come back on your next stay. You cannot experience Hong Kong and its history without also staying at The Peninsula. If you have a bucket list to visit Hong Kong, make sure it includes staying here. Don't forget to book the hotel Rolls Royce to pick you up at the airport."
137,Date of stay: April 2015,50,The best of the best of city hotels; wonderful dining experience,"There are countless wonderful experiences from staying at the Peninsula: immaculate Roman/Greek swimming pool overlooking the HK skyline, spacious well kept jacuzzis, large and well equipped gym, state of the art rooms with the most modern technology (don't bother bringing chargers - anything you need to charge is covered), up-to-date movies, comfortable high-count thread bedsheets, and of course, the staff - so professional that you don't even notice you're being served. The service is top-notch, friendly, as it is subtle and discreet. A must try is their buffet breakfast at the Verandah - the emotion inspired by the beautiful display of pastries, cold cuts, the omelette station, the dim sum station, juices, fruits and cereal, complete with a wild honeycomb, is akin to what a child feels walking into a well-stocked toy-shop. A live quartet band in the lobby too. I've only heard that the immensely popular Peninsula high-tea is over-rated, but didn't try that to review. There is a reason why they charge so much for rooms - because the Peninsula is really, one of the best in this world."
138,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Amazing Property!,"Upon entering the lobby it is obvious you have walked into one of the most iconic and grand hotels of the world. The service is impeccable and the staff is always willing to help in any request you may have.

The rooms are very big for Hong Kong standards and they all have an ample bathroom with double vanity and tub. In addition, the rooms also have a sitting area and a well-equipped office desk with a printer and fax. The ceilings in the original building are very high, which gives a greater sense of space and makes the room feel bigger.

The in-room technology is one of the most advanced and sophisticated I have seen. You can control everything from the iPad including the curtains, lights, TV, etc. Also, guests can make international calls free of charge.

The location is really convenient. It is close to major MTR lines and just a few minutes walk from the famous Star Ferry. Personally, I think Kowloon has great shopping and dinning options and it is close to the more local areas of the city such as Mong Kok.

Finally, no stay the this hotel would be complete without a Rolls Royce transfer. This truly is a once-in-a-lifetime experience."
139,Date of stay: April 2015,50,fantastic,"This hotel is beautiful. The staff are extremely helpful, personable and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. We took afternoon tea in the lobby and the food and service were perfect. The bedroom had numerous mod cons and th bathroom was enormous with every luxurious feature imaginable. The bed was super comfortable. Best city hotel I have ever stayed in."
140,Date of stay: March 2015,50,The Grande Dame - Strong as Ever,"I have been a visitor to the Peninsula Hong Kong for years, and consider it to be the epitome of excellence. The elegance, the service, the gleaming facilities, the food, the aura are all very special. It was for these reasons I wanted to share this property with my wife on our honeymoon. After a brutal direct flight from the States, we spent several nights recovering at the hotel, and using it as our launch pad for various adventures in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

Make the investment, and stay here."
141,Date of stay: June 2014,40,Technologically supreme!,"The hotel was wonderful although we did not have a view and were unable to change rooms. The technological upgrade made was supreme, to say the least. From pop-up make up mirror to finger nail dryer, all details were covered by the touch of a Tablet. Very nice from this point of view. The famous afternoon tea created quite a constantly over-crowded area in the main lobby which took away from the exclusiveness one would have expected. Can't wait to see other Peninsula properties!"
142,Date of stay: May 2014,50,A True World Class Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong for several days and I can truly say it was wonderful. Through our travel agent, we had pre-arranged for the hotel transfer through the hotel's fleet of rolls royce limos. What I didn't expect was to be met at the gate via an electric golf-cart and to be whisked the many miles through luggage collection and then customs. After after our mind-numbing 14-hour flight, this courtesy was enormously appreciated.

Upon arrival, the front desk manager personally escorted us to our room, showed us around, demonstrating how to use all the electronics and then we signed for incidentals, right in the room! And because they had an opening, they upgraded us to a suite with an amazing view of Victoria Harbor, free of charge.

We had breakfast in The Lobby every morning and never had a bad meal. Service was impeccable. One afternoon, I had high-tea and recommend having it if available, but just not on the same day as dim sum (like us!). I had the oolong tea and the food was plentiful. The only thing that was a bit of a hiccup was the shipping home of packages. We came to find out that shipping anything back to the US took time as you have many hoops to jump through. We simply had to allow more time and exercise patience. :)

The hotel itself was the picture of understated elegance. The Peninsula Hotel wasn’t the type of hotel that shouted class, but rather in what it didn't say that spoke the loudest. I found the service to carry a quiet confidence, unobtrusive and lacking in any airs or opinion other than supportive. First and foremost was this willingness to assist that made our stay so pleasant. There was nothing too much to ask. There was no eye-rolling or frozen faces with pasted on smiles you may get at other hotels. There was no sizing you up with chilled responses because you apparently wore the “wrong” outfit or asked the ""wrong"" question. No, this was a hotel that had so much class that it put you, the customer first, and because of that you could feel like right at home."
143,Date of stay: January 2015,50,World Class,"We stayed at this exceptional establishment in January 2012 when we first relocated to Hong Kong. As we were staying in one of the suites, we were greeted by a hotel representative as soon as we got off the plane. We were escorted to all the check points until we were greeted with our baggage on the other end. We were escorted to our transfer - a Rolls Royce Phantom. Our driver was attentive and friendly. A wonderful introduction.

We were greeted with smiles at the hotel entrance. Our check in was quick and professional. We were quickly escorted up to our suite. The service is meticulous.

Our suite was breathtakingly beautiful. It was beyond words. The marble bathroom was unlike anything we had ever seen.

The Peninsula Hong Kong is world class. It is by far our favourite five star hotel."
144,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Best Hotel in Hong Kong,We love the hotel and would go back or recommend to anyone. After the very difficult time though customs it was great to see the man with the sign for the hotel and the smile on his face was great. He had a car sent for us and the great time began. We loved this hotel and our visit to Hong Kong
145,Date of stay: December 2014,50,A wonderful lunch in the La Chiesa,We enjoyed a Christmas lunch in La Chiesa and the food was great and the service was marvellous. Even Father Christmas came! I am sure that the food would be as good every other day of the year. Christmas lunch was good value compared to UK prices.
146,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Subtle Glamour amidst New Heights of Comfort,"The Peninsula is the best location to explore the city with Tsim Sha Tsui MTR Station
right underneath it and the ferry terminal that is just a 5-minute walk away. The stunning view of the skyline and Victoria Harbor is a floor-to-ceiling panorama you can rest your eyes on without leaving the room. The night light show is also part of the room’s “décor”.

The service you will have a privilege to enjoy exceeds expectations. It seems every whim is possible. Every request, either it is a small favor to make your stay cozy or major planning of your city trips, is met with similar attentive, patient and competent attitude. It’s the level of focused attention I have never experienced anywhere. Whether you ask the best way to get to Aberdeen or choosing what type of transportation to use, you have a thoughtful discussion with details and advices.

Digital bedside tablets are fun. All in one remote control to manage room amenities, room service, spa and restaurant reservations.

Dining in the Peninsula’s Cantonese restaurant Spring Moon was a pure delight. Shadowed by the dim lights and surrounded by antiques and dark lacquered wood with a subtle murmur of guests and rich but well pronounced flavors, you immerse in the atmosphere of retro glamour. Though, full of inventiveness and posh attitude, Felix top-floor venue lacked in distinguished and palatable food taste. The Sun Terrace with light and healthy snacks, a Harbor view and a late November sun makes it the best leisure and lunch option.

One of the best treats offered was the hotel welcoming, which starts right when you get off the plane. A smiling petite woman meets you right at the gates and drives you fast and quick through airport's twists and turns. No passport control queues. And before you know, you are escorted by a formally clad hotel representative right into the parked Rolls-Royce. The check-in continues right in your room while you are sipping a Chinese tea from a pastel painted teapot and a matching set of cups adorned with a floral motif. The transfer service is a treat that makes a trip to Hong-Kong really special."
147,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Next stop is heaven!,"It was a special occasion so we decided to go to HK and stay at ThePeninsula Hotel. It was marvellous! The room was fantastic: spacious, light and with an equally appealing bathroom. The facilities included everything you could think of. You communicated with everybody through the IPad on the bedside table: concierge, food, laundry, tours. You name it and the IPad would find it! Room service was excellent and the staff were attentive and polite without being overbearing. The bars are intimate And clubby, the restaurants catered for western and eastern tastes. Every afternoon tea is served with a pleasant pianist on show. They pick you up from the airport in a Rolls Royce. To crown it all my husband wanted some made to measure shirts so we ordered them on Tuesday and they we're ready on Saturday from one of the shops in the hotel!"
148,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Afternoon tea anyone?,"Dropped by for tea and cake. Ground floor had a long queue, so went to first floor. As you'd expect, beautiful, impressive surroundings. Service was polite and impeccable and the cakes were waistline expanding beautiful. A quiet, civilised place to enjoy 'tiffin' and only £38, which for what it is, was reasonable."
149,Date of stay: March 2015,50,The Peninsula.Hong Kong,"I had the privilege to stay at this great place.

This hotel has been in Hong Kong for many years so it keeps old interior design which makes it unique.

The attention to detail is impressive, no matter where you go: the pool, spa, lobby for an afternoon tea, every detail, is just taken care of so very effectively

Highly recommended"
150,Date of stay: March 2015,40,"Once in your life you ""have"" to stay at the Peninsula...","...and thus we spoiled ourselves. The location is perfect: around the corner from a metro-station, 5min walk to the Star Ferry Terminal, stunning views of Hongkong Island (as long as you book a harbour view room!).
Unfortunately our room was at the back of the hotel and the huge window was extremly dirty. They blamed it on the pollution (and the air China sends across the border is truly dreadful and frankly makes a visit to Hongkong no longer enjoyable...), but thus the ""view"" was like staying in a **Hotel. :-(
The room itself was great. Huge bed, very spacious bathroom, intuitive control panels for everything, plus three I-pads as seperate control units. Shoes to clean go into a box which is accessed from the outside and are there again the next morning (including your newspapers).
Breakfast is served (large) buffet style at the Verandah till 10/10.30 am and a la carte in the Lounge till noon. :-))
The Felix Restaurant on the 28th floor has great views and ""creative"" cooking, but we do find tradional printed winelists easier to read and to compare than the I-pad versions which seem to be the rage nowadays...
A must visit is the woodpaneled Bar on the 1st floor. Colonial luxury surviving.
Last, but not least, the fitness center is huge and the SPA sublime. The sauna could be much hotter (set only to 75C). If you do want to have a massage, you better reserve when you book your stay as they are pretty well booked (ditto if you plan to have afternoon tea, the line was LONG!)
And if you can afford staying here, you can afford taking one of their Rolls Royces to the airport (""only"" about US$ 170 more than a taxi)."
151,Date of stay: August 2014,50,"The best services, the best hotel","This is perhaps the most meticulously perfect combination of luxury, old world and 5 stars service.
I can't say more about how happy we are to stay at this hotel.
The view is breath taking. It is also super convenient to go anywhere from this hotel.
Bravo!!!!!"
152,Date of stay: March 2015,50,Coming home after 27 years,During my business career in the 1980's I was a regular guest at The Peninisula and having to go back for a meeting this month I was excited to stay again. As always I was looked after virtually from the time the plane door opened until it closed behind me when I unwillingly had to go home. What can you say about an establishment where all of the staff are intelligent and dedicated to make your stay memorable. The room upgrade was fantastic especially the totally free telephone calls anywhere in the world. An intelligent lighting system that any layman can understand and the same for the TV controls. The lobby is as exciting as ever and just to sit again and have tea and an early evening drink was a pleasure. More superlatives will begin to bore you so if you have the opportunity at any time just go and you will see that I do not exaggerate.
153,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Charm and Efficient,"We stayed here for 2 nights in February 2015, and it was a wonderful experience. Even the bathroom was 6 star. Naturally the room had WiFi, but the VoIP phone was a real plus. The afternoon was an indulgence not to be missed. Totally wonderful."
154,Date of stay: March 2015,30,Average 3* hotel with 5* hotel pricing,"I stayed in this hotel for 1 night exclusively to experience the Rolls Royce ride. To keep my report organized I will mention the pros and cons during my stay.

Pros:
The Meet & Greet service was there at the airport upon arrival and I was escorted all the way to my car. My Rolls Royce car was there as promised. Upon arriving at the hotel my room was upgraded which gave me a good impression. Furthermore, I like the cinema atmosphere and the HD movies in my room. Watching movies in my room was really an exceptional experience which every one must have.

Cons:
Upon arriving at the hotel I was surprised that I was given a standard Rolls Royce car when there were other Rolls Royce cars with a curtain installed on the windows. In addition, the staff there from check-in to concierge seemed to be rushed and I did not get a quality information from the guy who checked me in neither the concierge. Furthermore, Neither the VoIP nor the toiler in my room were working. Finally, the staff in general do not seem to be interested in serving me. For example, I once asked in the swimming pool if I could get an extra apple, and instead of having him bring me the extra apple while I'm resting in my seat I had to get up and get one myself. This is definitely not what I expect from 5* hotels and services.

I mentioned my complaints to the front desk and received an e-mail from the hotel apologizing for the inconvenience caused. I replied back and told them that I was still in Hong Kong to work something out so that I would be pleased but the reply I got was the same message that was originally sent to me, which was an apology for the inconvenience caused. The e-mail admits that my toilet was indeed broken, and that it has been fixed.

I have asked to meet with the hotel management to work something out while I was still in Hong Kong but it seems that they were not interested in seeing me. I have also never received any form of compensation for the inconvenience caused during my stay. Other 5* hotels would provide me with a complimentary airport limousine transfer on the spot, but I received nothing from the hotel.

I would definitely not be coming back to this hotel, neither would recommend any one to stay there."
155,Date of stay: February 2015,50,An amazing experience,"We stayed just the two nights in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room (1911) which had the most wonderful view of the harbour and Hong King island, It was great to watch the nightly (at 8pm) light and laser show from our room that took place on the buildings both across on the island and on the mainland itself. The room was luxurious both the bedroom itself and the bathroom which had a separate showroom as well as a full sized bath.

The technology within the room was mind blowing and took some getting used to ! Beside each bed and on the writing desk were devices like tablet computers where you could control everything to do with the room - the lights, curtains, even request to Room Service. There was also the phones where you could ring anywhere in the world for free using the internet. There was a television for the bath .............. and so on.

Breakfast in The Verandah restaurant was a lovely experience where service was immaculate. The breakfast buffet had everything and if you wanted something else - you just asked and it was provided.

Service throughout the hotel was first class. We made great use of the concierge service who offered us allot of advice about where to go and how to get there. Nothing was too much trouble fir them and they were very keen to ensure our stay in Hong Kong was perfect.

A special hotel."
156,Date of stay: September 2014,50,A wonderful stay in early September,"I was travelling alone for business and I must say that the Peninsula was fantastic. Upon arrival I was given a surprise upgrade from a Kowloon view room, to a Harbour view room and it was absolutely stunning. Every staff member I encountered was gracious and exemplified the Peninsula standard.

The airport transfer service is a must too, it really takes the hassle out of a late evening arrival.

I am about to book my return visit in the summer with my Partner. Thanks again to the team for a wonderful stay."
157,Date of stay: January 2015,50,the helicopter ride,"there is a facility of booking a helicopter ride from the top floor of the peninsula hotel.
the service is run by the china clipper.

they take your for a 15-20 minutes arial ride over hong kong. the view is breathtaking..

it was superb to have gotten a lifetime opportunity like this..

please do it on a day when there is clear sky otherwise the smog will ruin all the views."
158,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Sublime Luxury,"From the moment you land at Hong Kong Airport you are welcomed into the effortless and smooth service of this grand Hotel. The drive by Rolls Royce to the Hotel, the in room check in and the welcome tea brought by the valet set the bar. Needles to say the room is equipped with every mod con you could wish for including iPads to control everything from lighting to curtains. The staff are trained to a high standard and gracious in their interactions with guests. The atmosphere in the Beautiful Lobby is as it should be of a hotel of this age and standard. Concierge Chris Cheung did a fantastic job arranging all our dinner reservations ahead of our arrival. I first stayed at this Hotel in 1980 and its standards have never dropped. I know that for business men the Mandarin Oriental might seem more convenient but in my opinion it does not compare."
159,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Chinese New Year Trip - top hotel,"I loved my stay at this my first hotel in China , they love to serve here and the restaurants are great and location excellent for the family with attractions and shopping all around . I think the concierge services here are like a hotel tourist bureau of national standard , and I highly recommend this hotel"
160,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Absolutely flawless stay,"I recently stayed at The Peninsula over Chinese New Year (2015).

The hotel is perfectly located at the tip of Kowloon, with dominating views of the skyline of Hong Kong Island. It is within 2 minutes walking distance of Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station. Nearby you can find Avenue of the Stars, HK Space Museum, HK Cultural Centre, Star Ferry Pier and the various shops and shopping centres of Canton Road. It is in a perfect location to visit or to travel to the main tourist sites.

The hotel decor is grand, colonial yet extremely modern and classy. The service is exceptional - all staff that we encountered were extremely helpful, polite and pleasant. Staff had a dedicated service for calling taxis from outside the main doors for guests. Housekeeping were also very helpful and any requests or queries that we had were addressed and resolved immediately.

We stayed in a Grand Deluxe Harbour View room and had the most wonderful view of the skyline. On the night of the Chinese New Year fireworks display we did not even have to leave the room - our windows were aligned directly across from the display.

The room was clean, spacious and filled with amenities. Fresh fruit was given for the duration of our stay, and we were also given sweets and green tea free of charge. The beds were clean and comfy. The room was controlled by electronic tablets, so we could control the tv, the lighting and the heating with ease.

We visited the spa on several occasions and the staff made our visits extremely enjoyable. I would recommend booking your appointments as soon as you arrive for your stay, but not earlier as this is not necessary - there were plenty of appointment times free when we enquired.

Overall, our stay was memorable and enjoyable with no issues.

I would note that many visitors are attracted to Afternoon Tea in The Lobby. I would highly recommend booking a table for this in advance at the start of your stay as this is an extremely popular meal, with long queues."
161,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Superb Hotel,"My first visit to Asia ,and this hotel was booked after good reviews from trip adviser ,extremely helpful staff great room ,very clean ,the room had a really nice pleasant smell , my food in the morning I felt was served by well mannered staff"
162,Date of stay: February 2015,50,A superb quality hotel,"The Peninsula Hotel is superb in every way and is located in the heart of the city, just across from the Harbour. The style and furnishings of the building, both inside and out, are magnificent and the impeccable service given by the staff to their visitors is a credit to the hotel. The room was beautifully furnished with all mod cons and a very comfortable bed. Breakfast was a buffet and the choice of foods was amazing. The lobby dining area was very relaxing, with a live musical ensemble and the food absolutely excellent. No wonder this is one of the best hotels in the world! It is an expensive treat but it was a great experience and we will be returning at some point."
163,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Great Hotel,"My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula in Hong Kong in January for 1 night for our 45th anniversary. we had a forced layover on our way to Singapore, and since it was such a big occasion, we decided to stay big. It was a great hotel. We weren't there long, just from around 5PM until 8AM, but it was certainly memorable.

We hired the car service from the airport to the hotel. There literally were 4 people who took care of us. We were amazed! Of course my husband didn't know who or how much to tip:))) We did not opt for the Rolls service because that was yet over $100 more. We stuck with the regular Mercedes service. On the way back, we just took a taxi, and what a difference! Worth it for the Peninsula service.

Our room was very nice, but somewhat on the small side. Our agent booked us the least expensive room on a package that included breakfast, tea, and $100 credit. She got us a double upgrade, but still the room was not big. It's an old hotel, newly refurbished, but I guess they still have to work with what they've got.

Our room was very narrow, but had a sofa and big screen TV. The entry way took up a lot of the room with beautiful wood closets and drawers. The bath was divided, with a separate small room with a sink and toilet. Then another room with another sink, tub and walk in shower. Lovely, but somewhat chopped up.

The service was perfect. Check in was done in the room, with a lesson on all the electronics for operating everything from the drapes, to a nail dryer. you could also call the States for free with voice over. Neat

We had breakfast in the beautiful lobby. What a treat. Certainly a memorable special anniversary."
164,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Expectation completed,Always expected the best service in Peninsula. The location is in the heart of the city. Great shopping and lots of public transportation surrounded the hotel area. The dining and pool service are one of the best I have encountered. Expansive but worth it for the experience.
165,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Fan Bloody Tastic,"Havent stayed for 10 years, but in thats time nothing has changed, excellent service, great views, stayed in the tower room, what a view, Please check out the pool and gym its brilliant. Anyone who isnt impressed wants their bumps feeling. This has to be one of the best hotels in the world, with an attention to detail that others should follow"
166,Date of stay: February 2015,50,"Great hotel, very good cost benefit.","One word for this hotel: luxury.
The attention to detail is impressive, no matter were you go: the pool, spa, lobby for an afternoon tea, every detail,is just taken care of so very delicately.
The amenities in the room are out of this world wonderful and surprising, they even have an Internet phone to make free international calls, you'll be all like ""what up? I'm calling free from Hong Kong!!"" :)
The rooms have really good black out so be careful if you have to be somewhere early in the morning.
Also, don't miss the breakfast buffet, it's soooooo good.
Just across the street from the Prninsula is the Hong Kong bay which makes a good siteseeing experience.
I highly recommend this hotel, it's really a most have experience.
If you want to grab something to eat, you can go the Intercontinental across the street and have a burger (please if you decide to go, have the burger it's amazing) and watch the bay. I recomed this because the city has outgrown the view from the Peninsula, so from the lobby it's impossible to watch the bay."
167,Date of stay: February 2015,50,Grande Hotel,"Thoroughly pleased.

We'd heard enough legends about this hotel prior to the stay, and all we can say is the hotel does live up to expectations in every which way. As one can tell, the structural layout of the rooms is the product of the old days, but the modern decor has almost done away with any possible sense of outdatedness. In fact, I'd much prefer to see the hotel rooms staying true to their historical past, but I guess modern life demands otherwise.

The hotel is legendary in many aspects. The room was spacious and equipped with state-of-the-art equipment and amenities. Bathroom felt a bit tradition but we had no problem with that; I personally appreciated that. The designs were quite thoughtful and considerate, and I was very fond of the lacquerware soap box and the welcome chocolate box, just what you'd expect from a fine hotel such as The Peninsula.

The location was perfect, situated in the heart of Tsim Sha Tsui in close proximity to a host of shopping malls and the sea front.

This place is simply the best symbol of luxury. It is my favorite in Hong Kong, on par with the Mandarin."
168,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Best of the Best!,"My husband and I spent the last night of our honeymoon at the Peninsula in a beautiful corner suite with the most incredible views of the Hong Kong skyline. If you have the means to upgrade to a room with a view - I HIGHLY recommend it! We were totally blown away! They had a bottle of champagne and a sweet congratulatory note waiting for us since we were on our honeymoon which was a really nice touch and made us feel special. The Peninsula is a true Hong Kong icon with a gorgeous lobby and old-school glamorous feel that made me think we had gone back in time! Each evening a string trio played beautiful music that floated through the lobby. Service is exceptional from every staff member you encounter. Breakfast in the morning was delicious! We missed tea but will have to do this next time as I heard it's lovely. We had one of the famous green Peninsula Rolls Royce's pick us up from the airport which was a REALLY cool experience and I can't recommend that enough! We felt like royalty. The hotel is in a great location as well, very short walk from the Star Ferry to bring you to Central. The Kowloon area directly surrounding the hotel is great for shopping and a little sight-seeing. Wonderful experience all-around and would highly recommend for those traveling to Hong Kong."
169,Date of stay: February 2015,50,A true icon in the city,"This hotel has been in Hong Kong for many many years so it keeps old interior design which makes it unique.
My husband and I were greeted by a hotel representative as soon as we cross the bridge leaving the airplane, we were taken privately to immigration and then to pick our bags. Afterwards, a Rolls Royce (the hotel has 14) was waiting for us with water and fresh towels.
As soon as we arrived in the hotel, our room was ready so we were escorted directly into our room and we did check in in our room. We were explained how The city is divided, what to do, how the room worked etc.
The service and food is delicious! The atmosphere at the hotel is very classy and the buffet breakfast amazing!!
I will definitely go back without a doubt, besides the city is the best!!!"
170,Date of stay: August 2014,50,The best experience ever in HK,"We will never forget this hotel, EXCELLENCE all over the place. Amazing Service, Superlative hotel, We LOVED IT!!!! an we mean that!!!! we love it!!!!!!! It's located very well and the rooms are amazing..."
171,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Cracking Hotel,"We stayed in this hotel in November having first visited it twenty three years ago. There is a picture in the foyer of the hotel in, I think, the 30s or the 40s with the harbour waves lapping against the edge of the hotel. Now the reclaimed land positions the hotel several hundred metres from the harbour.
On arrival the girl on reception accompanied us to our room on the 6th floor. Five minutes later the bell hop visited to show us the high tech gadgetry in the room and shortly afterwards a courteous maid greeted us with a pot of Chinese tea.
The electrics in the room were operated by two tablets computers. The lights could be turned of or off or dimmed in this way and the television channels changed. There was BBC World News as well as a host of other European channels.
Next to the Queen size bed was a VOIP phone offering free or cheap calls to wherever (I did not use it so cannot be sure) and the blinds operated electrically to shut off the world outside.
Hidden in a cupboard was a fax machine, a hairdryer and a device that dries nails. There were 4 USB points for recharging smart phones and an Iphone cable just in case you left yours behind.
There was a pod coffee machine and tea maker, a rainforest shower and his and hers wash basins with a stock of toiletries.
The style of the hotel was old colonial with modern facilities kept up to date.
This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in and its location on the southern tip of Kowloon next to the MTR and close to the Star Ferry makes it an ideal location for a holiday or business trip.
Oh, as you would expect for a hotel of this quality, Wifi was fast and free. European hotelliers take note please. Your days of charging for the uses of the internet are numbered."
172,Date of stay: March 2014,50,This is a Classic and First Rate place,I loved staying here and love their old school classic traditions. The rooms are wonderful and unlike a lot of old Hotels they are really kept it up to date including the dining. In my mind you cannot go wrong if you are looking for a high end Hotel in HK.
173,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Top hotel at supurb location,"I had the privilege to stay at this great place. The staff was more than great and did their level best to take of all my needs. It was a business trip but it
felt like vacation. They can expect me to stay their every time I will visit Hong Kong."
174,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Elegant stay,"Such a great stay--beautiful room and excellent service. We arrived after 20 hours of travel so it was nice to stay in a relaxing and beautiful hotel. It's right by the river so when we woke up, we were delighted to see the magnificent Hong Kong skyline."
175,Date of stay: November 2014,40,They've thought of nearly everything....almost,"The Peninsula Hong Kong is a grand hotel worthy of being compared with all other grand hotels of the world such as in Paris and London.

My experience of staying in one of their suites is indeed a memory to cherish and something I love to share with friends around a coffee table. Every details of the room has been carefully thought of and designed. There was a nail dryer in the dressing area stored in a customized drawer. Oh, I won't forget the convenient little valet door for newspapers delivery, shoe shine services and laundry collection, without the need to open the door!

Lighting and air conditioning, to mention a few, are controlled through tablets provided next to the bed or in the living room. One will need to be a bit technologically inclined to use them, I would think.

Room furnishing is just luxurious without being overwhelming.

At a place like this, my expectation for perfectness becomes more acute however. I would expect everything to be perfect the first time around. It was almost achieved except for the two disappointing experiences with the hotel provided transportation service.

The driver of the Rolls Royce who picked us up at the airport did not properly greet and smile at us, nor did he offer me or my party members any drinks. Only to discover later, after we asked, that the car refrigerator was full with bottled water for such purpose. That was a bad first impression leaving me in doubt over whether I have made a good decision in choosing this hotel.

The second time around, I hired a Mercedes Benz from the hotel for a city trip. I sat at the front passenger seat and tried to move the seat back a bit. It was broken and the driver knew about it beforehand. How disappointing that a hotel this class would give me a broken car. Being 6 foot tall (180 cm), it felt excruciating to ride sitting in such a contorted fashion and I ended up feeling some pain in my back.

When I complained to the management about those two occasions, I was given a complimentary car hire. Nonetheless, I expected everything to be perfect - the first time around!

In summary, the room was perfect and the food excellent but avoid using the hotel provided transport - that's what I will do for my future stays here."
176,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Superlatives don't do this grande dame justice,"Arrival: pay the extra for the Rolls meet n greet. Just wonderful to be carried away in a little electric golf buggy from the aircraft door, then glide into a Rolls phantom. Felt like a Kardashian for the day.
Check in done in the room, nice touch ( as was giving us a room at 9 am...thank you).

Room is super good. Excellent technology, free movies, free international calls ( VOIP ) .

Service prompt , excellent ( crumpled suit picked up, pressed and returned in one hour).

Concierge got us reservations at Sir David Tang's wonderful private members club, The Chinese Club. Arrange in advance as the Peninsula's guests are allowed in to the club....its stuffed with wonderful art ( Bacon, Klee , Warhol etc) and the food and music were great...v busy.

Great night club, and a lovely roof top bar.

Overall it's a joy to stay here, and we had a wonderful time.

One final note on the food front. If you like a Croque Monsieur then have one in the lobby restuaurant...same recipe since 1926, and we can see why. Perfection."
177,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Spectacular,"This is one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed in. The building is magnificent, the location is great to explore Kowloon & Hong Kong and the breakfast is one of the best you'll find anywhere. We opted for the RR airport pick up and drop off and we used the car several nights during our stay. Be aware that the RR car service ends at 12:30a... If you stay in a suite they provide free pick up and drop off in their mini-cooper's which is also a treat. The are many high end gift shops in the lobby area.

The apartment: Nespresso coffee & tea machine!!!! Fresh fruit everyday & flowers!!! Everything in the apartment is controlled by a tablet!!! Tons of free on demand movies, artwork, sculptures in the room and a full functioning office was very convenient for conducting business while in town. Also they have free int'l voip phone service. The bathroom is completely marble.

Service: They catered to our every need and even to a few unusual requests.

Location: Kowloon. Amazing location in Kowloon but Kowloon, not HK

Do yourself a favor, book this hotel and don't look back!"
178,Date of stay: February 2014,50,beautiful historic building,"the peninsula hotel is a beautiful historic building situated in the heart of honk kong, close to shopping and attractions. the staff are very helpful and polite and always try to help as much they can. very clean, and well set out rooms. the chauffer cars are rolls royce's which is a treat to be in ! i definitely reccomend staying at the peninsula"
179,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Amazing stay,"We stayed at one of the harbour view suites for our wedding. The suite was slightly smaller than my expectation but it was still very nice. Everything you would expect from a five star hotel chain. Service was impeccable! They offered very personalised services, which was the cherry on the chocolate cake. Would stay here again!"
180,Date of stay: January 2015,50,Far East Trip,"What a fantastic hotel, the view from our harbour room is incredible, especially at night.
Have your breakfast by the pool on the eight floor,overlooking the harbour area.
The rooms are the best we have stayed in , all services controlled by iPad. Afternoon tea is a must,but pre book as there can be an hour wait as it's the place to come for tea,very British.
The service is exceptional . The shopping area is close by and a trip on the Star Ferry is a must."
181,Date of stay: January 2015,50,superb,"1st time in HK, couldnt fault the Peninsula, service overall, hotel room, bars, restaurant, pool and Spa along with location all first class..Rooms spacious with excellent media facilities, free wifi, Ipad controlled media. Bfeakfast includedd was exclellent, Felix roof bar expensive but awesome view and worth the experience ."
182,Date of stay: June 2014,50,A Must when coming to Hong Kong,Try the 5 o´clock Tea Time Set in the Lobby - There is nothing more to say about the Hotel - Simply perfect in all aspects - try the limo service to or from the airport - the only green RRs in Hong Kong
183,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Perfect for honeymooners!,"We stayed at the peninsula for just one night but it was one of the best hotels we stayed at! So relaxing, rooms are perfect, the view was just breathtaking! The location is very convenient, in fact, the peninsula is a landmark in hongkong and the shopping around it is really nice. The hospitality was incredible, the staff friendly abd caring. They speak English, mandarin snd Cantonese there, one maid even spoke a little bit of Russian. We we're impressed and will definitely recommend this hotel for young couples to stay for a night of romance."
184,Date of stay: January 2015,50,The Legend Continues Strong,"I have just completed my 5th stay at this legendary hotel. I continue to be impressed with the extremely high attention to detail that the staff demonstrates. From the moment I exit the jetway I am escorted by the Peninsula assigned rep with an electric cart that whisked me thru the long concourses of the Airport, thru immigrations and into a waiting Rolls Royce and relaxing 30 minute drive to the hotel where Sean was waiting as I exited the limo and escorted me directly to my room where the check in process was completed. The Spa treatment was top notch. The food at the hotel was 5 star. The rooms are fully high tech with great wifi connections. I appreciate being able to operate anything in the room via iPad from A/C to Curtains, Lights and the TV. The return to the Airport was the same as my arrival. fully escorted from getting out of the limo and escorted to the Airline check in counter to security. I have tried other hotels in HKG only to ask why afterwards."
185,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Hong Kong Peninsula - wonderful,"This trip was to celebrate a special birthday for my partner and with apologies, is over a year late (actually June 2013) as we never quite got round to writing it up. We did the Peninsula Bangkok, the Eastern & Oriental Express from Bangkok to Singapore, Raffles Singapore and then the Peninsula Hong Kong. This was the final leg of our trip and we were collected from the airport by the Hotel's Rolls. In fact, they met us getting off the plane and whisked us through the airport which was excellent. We love Grand Dame hotels and the Hong Kong Peninsula did not disappoint. It had recently had a major refurb and everything is much more modern than its Bangkok sister with a tablet in the room controlling pretty much everything which was fun. The cubby hole to put your laundry in is a hoot as you pop it in and someone comes along and takes it out the other side! Afternoon tea is a real experience in the beautiful and elegant lobby but be sure to book in advance as there's a big queue of non-residents hoping for a table. We ate at the hotel's wonderful French restaurant called Gaddi's which was fabulous - we're very critical foodies but this was one of the best meals we have ever had and was faultless. The restaurant is wonderfully spaced, service is superb and the live band really adds to the atmosphere. The hotel is supremely comfortable and the indoor pool with spectacular views is amazing. We had a few hours to kill between checking out and leaving for the airport so we had a swim there before showering and leaving for the airport and it was lovely. Highly recommended."
186,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Iconic and Excellent,"This is a top class world hotel, with truly excellent service , great restaurants, afternoon tea the way it should be, and luxury design and facilities. Everyone is so welcomed here and on my stay I say lots of happy business people, shoppers, families and young trendies too. Location is great for tourists too. Top"
187,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Great Family Stay,"From checking in to enjoying afternoon tea in The Lobby to the impeccable spa, the Peninsula does not disappoint!!! We did a stay-cation with a preschooler and a 2-month-old. The moment I stepped into the hotel, I was impressed by the service. This was my 4th time at their spa and still, one of my favourite spa places. They helped us reserve a table for afternoon tea after the spa service. They even gave my baby everything he needed- crib, baby supplies (including a cute ""Peninsula bear"" bib!), towel, etc. which we got to take home. The room was beautifully designed and so spacious. What a treat!!!"
188,Date of stay: November 2014,50,"Couldn't be more comfortable, and well taken care of","Just a lovely hotel, with great caring staff, eager to please. Amenities in the room, include a free satellite telephone line for all international calls, free WIFI and a fax machine. There was a complimentary carafe of fresh squeezed orange juice, and shortly after arrival, hot complimentary jasmine tea was delivered to my room. The breakfast buffet is outstanding. This is one of the nicest hotels I have ever stayed in, and if it were not such a long flight to Hong Kong, for me, I would fly there regularly, just to stay in the hotel and be pampered."
189,Date of stay: February 2014,40,"Luckily, some things don't change","The impact of the hotel has been somewhat lost over the last 20-40 years as more and more buildings have edged closer to the front of the hotel - which used to front on to the harbour but, luckily, inside the grandeur is still there and afternoon tea is a delight to linger over. A glass of champagne with delicious sandwiches and cakes and some excellent tea make the people watching through the palm fronds even more enjoyable. Worth every penny for the blast of a colonial past this hotel gives you."
190,Date of stay: January 2015,50,A Memorable Stay,"I stayed 2 nights last january before cruising.
This hotel limo service was the best in my experience.
A harbor view room was very spectacular
and needless to say,this renovated suites room was convenient and comfortable
also spa service and facility were wonderful.
They arranged some welcome gifts like a champagne and cake for our special day.
I highly recommend this nice property to everyone visiting in Hong Kong."
191,Date of stay: August 2014,50,As good as ever,"Pick up from the airport by Rolls Royce is a smooth way to reach the hotel. Check in was very prompt and our room was beautiful, overlooking the harbor. Fresh juices in the room on arrival with a nice plate of petit-fours. Rooms are large with a good dressing space and a well appointed bathroom. Free WiFi. The food was excellent throughout whether the high tea, the dim-sum lunch at the Chinese restaurant or the private dinner made by banquet.
The location is perfect to explore the city and to do a bit of shopping.
This is definitely a world class experience."
192,Date of stay: December 2014,50,"Beautiful hotel ... great for tea, shopping, view at the bar & good restaurants","While I have not stayed at the Peninsula, I have been there quite a few times for shopping (good mix of high end brands which are everywhere & smaller boutique brands), tea (best tea & treats in Hong Kong), dining (good variety) and a drink at the bar (great view)"
193,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Amazing Stay,"I recently stayed at the Peninsula whilst on business. I can say this is by far one of the most amazing hotels I have ever stayed at. Everything has been thought of from forgotten phone chargers (they have anyone you might need already in your room) beautiful finishings and amazing amenities.

The staff were so welcoming and friendly. The hotel looked absolutely beautiful during the Christmas period with decorations, ginger bread houses and model trains.

I think a lot of hotels could learn something from the Peninsula with its first class service, gorgeous rooms and attention to detail. I can't wait to come back!"
194,Date of stay: January 2015,50,It is one of tThis places where I can relax most hotel！,"There are one of the world's best services at this hotel.
Of course it was supported by a tradition.
I learn nostalgia even if I visit this hotel how many times！
A tradition of the Commonwealth of Nations still breathes.
I will visit here again."
195,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Not much to say...,"It's just a lesson in how hotels should always be.

Elegant, first-class in every detail, flawless service, incredible views, beautiful, spacious rooms.

When it's this good - you don't need many words - but here's one:

Impeccable."
196,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Flawless,"It is The Peninsula - everything you've heard is true, and if you're a frequent guest like me then the minute you jump in the car or walk in the door, you are home. If you've not stayed before, you will wonder why you do live here.

Yes, the rates are high but the service and presentation is worth every cent. The more experienced staff will anticipate your wishes and if they haven't will move heaven and earth to deliver them - yesterday.

If it's not in your budget, then at least put on a good pair of pants, shirt blouse dress and shoes and visit the lobby even for just a cup of coffee sometime during the day. Experience it once in your life.

Room wise, everything you would wish for - even in the smaller rooms. Every time I'm 'in residence' I find myself calculating how exactly I could live here permanently... and I do that at the Savoy too.

Despite the excitement of Hong Kong outside the door, you will need to book at least 2 wake up calls, as you won't want to leave bed."
197,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Par excellence,This hotel is worth every cent for the excellent facilities and services. The view of the harbor is awesome. The room is spacious and is fitted with the latest gadgets. I was pleasantly surprised that I can make free IDD call to anywhere in the world. The high tea is legendary and does not disappoint. This is definitely one hotel that should be in your bucket list. The whole hotel is saturated with class and service par excellence.
198,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Luxury Travel Destination in Hong Kong,"the journey begin just when you stepped out from the airplane, the hotel assistant will pickup using a buggy and assist you through the immigration as well as pickup your luggage go through the custom and bring you the rolls royce that has been waiting for you and go to peninsula. We stayed in one of the suite, once we arrive at the hotel, the manager welcome us and we do the check in inside the suite. the room was amazing, spacious and very high tech. the movie also uptodate. not to forget the spa and pool was to die for. very recommend and will be back when we visit HK next time. One more thing, peninsula high tea is as famous as what i have heard. they serve very good tea time in the lobby. make sure you make a reservation as its a very long q everyday"
199,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Perhaps the Best Hotel in the World,Ive stayed in this hotel several times over the years. It is certainly my favorite hotel in the world and I can't imagine its not among the best hotels in the world. It's actually an old hotel so the rooms are large and spacious but it has been beautifully restored to world class luxury. Its a little more to stay here but the experience of a lifetime.
200,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Wow I LOVED this hotel,"We stayed in a Harbour deluxe view on the 22 floor; jaw dropping views and a beautiful room, extremely elegant and comfortable and really good amenities; music and coffee. Great bathroom.
The service is amazing. The restaurants are fabulous; breakfast was wonderful.
We arrived at 4pm and I was a bit shocked and at first disappointed by how busy the lobby was - it reminded me of a casino in Vegas. But of course, this is when the famous high tea is. The lobby was much quieter at other times of the day and very beautiful. We stayed from Dec 4-8 and the Christmas/holiday decorations were stunning.
The concierges at this hotel are brilliant. Nothing is too much trouble - and they know their stuff and can get you a reservation anywhere!
This hotel wasn't inexpensive but for my husband and I it was worth every penny."
201,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Tradition meets technology in one of the most well appointed rooms I have ever stayed in.,"My husband and I stayed at the Peninsula for a pre-Christmas treat. And what a treat it was. We were upgraded to a harbour view deluxe suite with a sitting room and bedroom - both of which had stunning views over Victoria Harbour. The light show never looked so good as it did from the comfort of our chaise longue. We were so delighted with the room that we decided not to go out and ordered room service. The dim sum was divine and the Chinese stir fried steak melted in the mouth. My tuna steak was over done and a little dry, but perhaps I should not have asked for it to be cooked 'medium'. After dinner, we used the 3D glasses to watch a movie. Exceptionally high quality sound and vision. Everything in the room is controlled by a tablet, lights, air con, curtains, TV etc. Very clever, although we repeatedly received an error saying that our room was not authorised to play movies when in fact they were complimentary. Another very fun thing about being a suite guest is that you have use of one of the hotel's two mini pullmans to drive around town. What a perk! We used the shoe polish service while we were there thinking it would be excellent. It was not, sadly. But that did not detract from a wonderful stay. The room was wonderful and breakfast in the lobby lounge the following morning was also very good. The big question is: did The Pen trump the Mandarin Oriental? It came very close.... But the unrelenting attention to detail at the Mandarin keeps it at the top spot for me."
202,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Thrilling Luxe Experience,"One of my best city hotel experiences ever.

PICK-UP/CHECK-IN/DEPARTURE
We splurged with a Rolls Royce pick-up which included a concierge meet & greet at the gate, baggage handling, and a Peninsula hand-off representative who took us to the car. On leaving the hotel for Bali, we had the same car, plus a rep who literally escorted us and took our luggage to check-in and then too security. Effortless and regal. Check-in was in-room and exceedingly fast.

ROOM
We had the highest category of room before the suite level, which was in the new tower overlooking HK Bay. Flawless view. New decor is Asian minimal, striking the right balance between modern and comfortable. We loved the details like the starched sheets, mattress cover, head/wall board paneling, wall art, electronic vanity mirror, beautiful lacquered wood and all of the desk supplies. Plus, every socket imaginable and perfect technology. Nespresso coffee machine (I love it!) and a selection of teas. The bathroom is perfect for two, with all supplies provided without asking. Water pressure in shower was amazing. Toiletries smell great. They thought of everything in a pre-emptive manner. Gripes? The room decor was almost too neutral and antiseptic; a colored pillow or two (like in photos), a cashmere throw and/or some flowers might have brightened things up a touch. Also, it could have used a couch. I noticed this large room is advertised on the website with a couch and small coffee table, but only had an uncomfortable divan in reality. Were we given a less appealing room? I was a bit annoyed by this decor misrepresentation. They also forgot to remove the alcohol from the room, which I had requested in advance.

RESTAURANTS
We only ate at The Verandah and had afternoon tea in the lobby. Both were very good. FYI, they have a VERY limited and unappealing room service menu for a five star property, which forced us to go down to The Verandah for dinner one night (please see my separate review). As to the quintessential afternoon tea, service was stiff and the sweets were a disappointment. Still, the scones, tea and experience, especially with Christmas singers, is something to try at least once in your life. We had a lobby breakfast once which was terrific.

SPA
Hands down the loveliest hotel spa decor I've ever seen and experienced. It's a definite WOW. The ambience is to-die-for with rich woods, beautiful marble floors, fountains and candles. They escort you everywhere. The men's sauna actually looks out on to HK bay. They have a crazy-wonderful rainforest shower with aromatherapy and mist built in. An ice machine pumps new ice on to the towels every few minutes. I mean it's insane. The crystal steam room is a bit too bizarre and sci fi for my taste. The massage itself was very good, though not the best I have ever had.

SERVICE
Really top notch. Every request was met almost immediately. They knew my name everywhere. They never balked at our being a gay couple. Clearly everyone is well-trained and disciplined. Would I say they are the warmest bunch? No, definitely not, except the lovely folks in the spa. Generally, it's like a five star army brigade. Everything is done masterfully, if a bit remotely, and yet I was very pleased.

HOTEL COMMON AREAS
This is a Grand Dame property and I got a little excitement walking in each day. That said, the lobby is a mess, especially during Christmas, with tourists, singers, decorations, lounge acts, and staff running around. I know they are famous for their lobby tea and so this set-up is not going to change, but perhaps it could be fine-tuned a bit? I'm not a snob, but for this kind of hotel and the prices guests pay, some degree of velvet rope exclusivity should be enforced (in the lobby but not arcade? or maybe in one area?). It's a strange set-up with the high-end mall above the lobby (and with some stores on the lobby level too) that somehow needs to be slightly reworked for the hotel's prestige and current times. It's all a touch too hectic at first. Five star hotel guests don't want to deal with these crowds. But, once you get into the hushed, plush corridors of the hotel it is a peaceful, luxe world, but getting there can be a slight hassle. The hall decor is wonderful by the way.

OVERALL
A faultless experience. At this level, my few complaints are splitting hairs. Again, an excellent city hotel, and a great option for business (albeit not on the HK side). Because of the lobby problems and atonal service, I might try the Four Seasons next time. Speaking of FS, I am writing this from FS Bali (Sayan) which has some of the intangibles that I think the Peninsula lacks with its clinical approach to luxury."
203,Date of stay: December 2014,40,Afternoon tea,"We came for afternoon tea and ended up in the bar, eating small tidbits and drinking champagne, as the downstairs tea room was too full. It was very tasty and the service was good (although very odd in a way as they always speak to the man, not to the lady). I'd go again but was quite glad having decided against staying at a hotel of this size and with such a tourist presence."
204,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Superb service,The Peninsula is ideally located and in close proximity to the shopping districts and to the Harbor terminal. Service at the hotel was impeccable and the rooms were well appointed and very comfortable. I would highly recommend the Peninsula and we will stay here again when we return to Hong Kong.
205,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Prestige and Luxury,"If you can afford this hotel and you are accustomed to luxury, then The Peninsula is the place to stay. Is it located on the Kowloon side, but it is simple to take the Star Ferry or subway to HK Island.

The rooms are recently redone and they have the most off the charts electronic system in the room that can do everything and anything. It is truly impressive.

The lobby offers a lovely place for tea and morning breakfast.

The French restaurant is devine and should be a 2 star Michelin, however, the chef does not want to apply for such a rating. There is a subway stop right in front of the hotel.

Service and quality are impecible."
206,Date of stay: January 2014,40,Business / Leisure,"Stayed at The Peninsula May 2013, luxurious traditional hotel was picked up in a traditional green Phantom from the airport.

Arrived at the Hotel shortly after 30min Drive, it was late evening. Hotel well presented, traditional enjoyed the hustle and bustle in the lobby area during afternoon tea.

That was about two or three hour wait, for afternoon tea in the lobby. Reminds me of the Copacabana palace Hotel.

Reception and concierge service very helpful, bit of a long walk from the escalator to the room. Breakfast had a large variety of different nationalities.

Overall luxurious"
207,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Honestly - The best experience I have ever had in a Hotel - Honeymoon Couple,"We stayed in the Peninsula for the second leg of our Honeymoon on the way back from Bali flying home to the UK. I reached out to the Hotel in advance to let them i know my wife and I would be traveling for our Honeymoon. The response we received was unbelievable. These guys seriously went to Town with our stay. Personalized greeting from the moment we arrived, organized possibly the best dinner I have ever had with a personalized Menu in three of their restaurants with a personal greeting from the Head Chef. They also organized a special after hours night where we got access to their private members room with a special guest performance. Both my wife and I are Muslim so the Barmen had prepared us special non alcoholic cocktails. He even came over to introduce himself and advise what he had put into the drink and why. Furthermore, the chef for our meals had also prepared halal food for us which is not a standard offering. I have to say I have had some great experiences in hotels but this evening took the biscuit - honestly one of the best evenings i have ever had! Thanks to all the staff who made that evening magical. The names of everyone elude me but Anita Li was the person i emailed so presume she organized everything for us.m I want to say a personal thank you to everyone who made the evening special. (Kevin Tsang, Danny Chan, Dorico Lp, Ada Lam, Ada Tung, Aileen Olympia, Chris Cheng, Jessica Cheng, Keiko Ota, Michelle Ho, Raoul Hoelzle, Samson Lam and Mahsahisa Oba)

We also had Afternoon tea and once again they prepared a special table with a personalized halal menu. This experience was unbelievable and because we made them aware in advance we bypassed the very long queue and got ushered straight to our table. AMAZING EXPERIENCE.

In summary i have to say The Peninsula was one of the best experiences I have ever had staying at a Hotel. The staff were personable, the room was amazing, Food from a different world . Honestly, this stay made our Honeymoon amazing. A very kind Thankyou from both my Wife and I. AMAZING."
208,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Perfect hotel if you can afford the price,It's nice return to the Peninsula hotel HK. Always excellent services and make you feels VIP. The room was clean and up to date . Basically nothing to complain. Breakfast was good at the lobby and lots of choice at the first floor. Wifi was the best among all hotel in HK. I would come back again for sure.
209,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Pure Luxury!,"This was the first stay at a Pennisula for my husband and I. It will certainly not be the last! We made our reservation through American Express, so we enjoyed a $100 credit voucher for food/beverage throughout our stay, as well as, complimentary breakfast. The only negative about the property is that it is so beautiful, that many locals and tourists want to visit making the lobby extremely busy! Our room was superb! Everything in the room (lights, TV, surround sound, blackout shades, etc) were controlled by three ipads. We had five telephones throughout the room, with complimentary long-distance international calling! The staff arranged for desserts, and a bottle of champagne complimentary for our anniversary...talk about luxurious!! Just one of the benefits staying with the property, is you're able to make a reservation for afternoon tea in the lobby which they are famous for! If you're not a guest, you must wait in a very long line to be seated. We walked right in to our table with no wait. The tea was fabulous! The table was set with silver, fine china, starched linens, and assortment of goodies. You can linger for hours! We ended our stay with a chauffered Rolls-Royce to the airport in Hong Kong. This property fall exceeded our expectations, and we certainly look forward to more stays in the future!"
210,Date of stay: December 2014,50,Best in terms of service and technology,It is a class apart truly a seven star and deserves No1 rating in hk. The service is superb and the room is top class. This is best hotel I have seen using technology . Service is top class. They have pool and spa services on the 8th floor which also has amazing view. One my best stays . Kohli nor of Hongkong.
211,Date of stay: December 2014,50,"Excellent stay, great suite & pool!","We had requested the Rolls Royce return transfer and we were pleased to discover that contrary to other hotels (Mandarin Oriental Bangkok for example) you don't have to request additional VIP service, their 'regular' service takes you in charge right at the exit of the plane to the passport control with a small electric buggy and then to the car avoiding the crowds behind you.
Check-in was done in the suite, luggages were delivered within minutes and a welcome tea was offered, together with a huge fruit plate (replenished daily) and chocolates already displayed on the dining table.
Regarding the grand deluxe harbour view suite #2316 we stayed in, only positive things to say except that foyer is totally useless, I would add some storage space there for coats & shoes as it is large enough to make this modification. Otherwise the lay-out is great and well thought. Probably one of the nicest city suite we had. TVs, 3D Blu-Ray players both in the bedroom and the living room, 2 minibars, everything you can expect is there, and more.
Technology is very simple and user friendly. Complimentary high speed internet, on-demand movies at no charge, they did a great job but they could go even further. IPad-like device allow you to open/close curtains, it gives information about hotel services, weather, etc. but I don't understand why you can't actually place an order for room service directly through this device, instead of having to call room service in the old fashioned way. The best technology I saw so far was at Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles. I hope Peninsula can develop their system and implement the same services.
We had breakfast at la Verandah on the first morning. It is an extensive buffet with high-quality products. We also tried in-room breakfast but it was less good.
The swimming pool (floor #8) is beautiful and feels far more luxurious than what I expected from the pictures I saw. The official website doesn't make justice to the place! There is a terrace with sun loungers but in December it is not warm enough outside to enjoy it. You can be served breakfast and light dishes by the pool. Service is excellent.
Overall we had a great stay. Hard product is in mint condition with nice modern decor, location is excellent, I'm glad we chose Peninsula over the other luxury properties on the island."
212,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Awesome Experience,Hotel staffs were accommodating and friendly. I love the bedside tablet that controls everything in the room and you can even change the language that you want to use. The room was well maintained. Internet is also fast which is what every businessman needs when traveling.
213,Date of stay: November 2014,50,The best historical hotel in Hong Kong,"I think that is the best hotel in Hong Kong. The location is very good, just next to the Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (underground) station. Opposite to the Space Museum and Art Museum, ten minutes walk to the Science Museum. Five minutes walk to the Star Ferry. You must travel by ferry at least once. It takes only ten minutes from Tsim Sha Tsui to Central. It is cheap(less than US$0.5) and wonderful, because you can see the beautiful view of Victoria Harbour. Back to the hotel, ask for a room with seaview. It is amazing! Don't forget to walk around in the hotel, because even the Japanese Army used this hotel as their Headquarter during the Second World War !!!"
214,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Worth the money - brilliant experience,"Yes its a lot of money, but you get an amazing experience in return. My wife and I stayed at the Peninsula for our honeymoon and it was everything we had imagined. I had emailed ahead to let them know it was a special occasion, and we were met out the front of the hotel by the hotel manager to personally greet us. We were then taken straight to our room without any front desk check-in. They took care of all of this while we were in our room with a glass of champagne.

The rooms are very well appointed with the touch screen control panels by each bed and at the desk. You can control almost everything in the room from these including TV. Blinds, air conditioning and room service.

Rolls Royce transfer from the airport is a fantastic touch. They met us at the gate when we got off the plane and walked us through the airport and took us straight to the waiting car.

just close your eyes when you pay."
215,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Superb Luxury /A+++,"I am totally bias but the Peninsula Hong Kong is one of my two favourite hotels in the world, besides the Park Hyatt in Hamburg /Germany.
Great, extremely friendly, committed and highly professional staff.
Perfectly thought through hotel concept, service and amenities (rooms, hotel transfer with RR, SPA restaurants etc.)
It seems that staff anticipates what a traveller (on business or family vacation) requires and delivers every time.
Simply amazing and refreshing

Love it and as mentioned before an all time favourite gem!"
216,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Great Place to stay and best restaurants and bars,The hotel is one of the most iconic places in Hong Kong. The rooms are spectacular. You can see the hole bay from every room. Th lobby is amazing. Every single detail in there is taken care off. The dinning at the Felix is a one of a lifetime experience. Fancy place great menu from traditional to molecular food. The way the menu is presented in ipads is trendy and helpfull. Very good whine list. You can have whine from all over the world. After dinner you can go to the bar the atmosphere is great. Amazing cocktails and views. Its not cheap but is sure worth every cent.
217,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Best hotel...,"After getting married, we stayed in HK and Japan for honey moon. We picked Peninsula Superior Suite and stayed there for 6 days. We stepped out the plane and immediately we were picked up by porter to help us with our luggages both hand carry and checked in one. Roll Royce picked us up and we had a last min request and the hotel was fast in response and immediately amend the arrangement so we felt great. The checked in was done in the room and experience was very good to avoid checking in at the reception. They hv on arranged everything and we wait no time as they r the one waiting and helping.

We had also had the ""Fly & Dine"" in Peninsula to incl a 15-min fly in helicopter to enjoy the beautiful view of HK as well as a fantastic dinner in Glady's. The entire experience was great, my husband and his daughter were very happy.

Lots of many things that Peninsula had been extremely attentive and I felt sincerely I was well respected and treated as a customer. One nite, after our wedding reception party, we took a cab back to hotel and the staff opened the door but a bottle of champ in the car fell broken on the floor becoz of that. My husband wasn't happy as the staff broke the champ and the manager immediately personally attest to this and apologise for it and he organised a chilled same bottle champ to our room for us to compensate. I mean, that was an accident and the manager made the immediate action and we both very much appreciated.

We came back after Japan as we had a couple of hours staying in HK before we flies back to Amsterdam, we booked a normal standard room and they immediately upgrade is also the transport to airport to Roll Royce again.

One must mention is that, once we arrived airport heading back to Ams in HK. There was a staff from Peninsula (40-50 years old gent) helping out with our check in. He was extremely friendly and very very helpful as we had soooo many luggages and he stayed with us the entire check in process and helping us to bring the odd sized luggages to counter etc... All the little things he did made a very good impression for us!

We are going to HK for CNY holiday, usually we wld stay in Intercontinental but due to the great experience, we are reconsidering to stay in Peninsula again.

Thanks for giving us such a great experience!"
218,Date of stay: January 2014,50,wonderful traditional hotel,"Stayed here for two weeks on business recently. All the superlatives apply here. From the collection from HK airport on Lantau island by Rolls Royce to the a la carte food in the restaurants - simply superb. Perhaps a little dated now by downtown HK standards but still the only real traditional place to stay. Excellent standards throughout, superb rooms and suites marvellous attentive staff. I always stay here in the peace and quiet away from the frenetic bustle of HK and Kowloon. And so should you. Highly recommended - simply the best."
219,Date of stay: January 2014,50,The hotel which I can spend most comfortably!,"There are hotel, it which I can spend most comfortably in Hong Kong.
It will be the best hotel in the east than the Suez Canal which a tradition and the history built up!
Because the staff is succeeded from generation to generation and works, the legend of this hotel still breathes."
220,Date of stay: February 2014,50,The best of the best,"the best of the best i have stayed at most of the Peninsula hotels around the world and the Hong Kong one is the best, location is great the staff are fantastic they are so helpful nothing is to much trouble, arrive in stile have the rolls royce transfer from the airport.
food was 5 star"
221,Date of stay: November 2014,50,When only the best will do,"Once again stayed at the Peninsula Hotel for our last night of our HK holiday and well worth the additional expense. Everything about the Peninsula is an experience in luxury and pampering. My wife cannot get over the TV in the bathroom, allowing her to watch her favourite programs while soaking in the very deep bath, without being interrupted by me wanting a shower, which in other hotels is usually over the bath, but no, at the Peninsula, it is a separate shower cubilce, and toilet cubicle, double handbasins and the best complimentary soap and soap holders ever seen. staying at the Peninsula entitles you to avoid the long queue that gather averyday to take High Tea and in fact, you can have High Tea long after the normal 4.30pm cut off. Of course, all the staff are impeccable and so friendly, without being invasive to your space, they are very discreet in their service,, even when in comes to turning back the bed for you at night and laying out your slippers and restocking the Nespresso machine."
222,Date of stay: November 2014,50,A new aspect,"On the occasion of our 37th anniversary and my birthday, my husband and I decided to stay at this hotel to their newly renovated guest room. This was our first come back to this property after several years of absence. We used to like this property very much but as time goes by, some amenities became out dated, then we ventured out to other hotels such as the Four Seasons and the Ritz Carlton at the ICC location.

We were welcome back as family members which really impressed the two us. When the extended edition of the Rolls Royce Phantom was still outside the street, we already noticed several members of the staff with a big beautiful bouquet of flowers were already waiting for us. While getting out of the limousine, everyone gave me a big hug. We were lead directly to our room where more surprises were waiting.

The room has a very simple and elegant decor with modernized facilities. Everything is controlled by a tablet which is use friendly. I just visited their new property in Paris and many of the facilities are the same. The bathroom remains unchanged. We did suggest the hotel management to change the toilet bowl to the one in Paris and Tokyo. The one In Tokyo is even better with automatic cover which will lift up by itself and pull down after use. No hand contact needed.

The TV in the room is huge and many movies are offered with compliment of the hotel. Bathroom amenities are from Oscar de la Renta that the hotel group is using in recent years. There are many plugs available in different locations of the room. Thus my husband and I didn't have to wait for our turn to charge our gadgets. There are more devices in the drawer of the night stand!

A LED lighted mirror comes up at the dressing table with a push of button.

It's a total new experience with the new renovation. The hallways are becoming brighter and more welcoming.

Housekeeping has always been superb and same as hotel staff. Everyone is smiling and greeted us by our last name. Chief Concierge managed to make us some very difficult to get restaurant reservations. My extended gratitude to Ms. Rainy Chan, GM ; Mr. Oba, manager; Mr. Kevin Tsang, F&B Director; Ms. Vindy Lui, Director of Catering and Conference; Ms. Ada Tong; and certainly Ms. Echo Chu, Chief Concierge. And many other managers and staff members including Mr. Florian Trento, Group Executive Chef and chef Remi at Gaddi's, who made our trip the most memorable one.

The bed is super comfortable. Furnitures are very classy and match exactly with the hotel style.

Location is well appointed with subway station just across the street from the side entrance.

A huge shopping mall is in walking distance. I also highly recommend restaurants in the hotel are all worth to try. Service is the Peninsula signature.

We look forward to going back to this property in our next visit to Hong Kong."
223,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Great Hotel,"Airport pick up service by a chauffeured Rolls Royce was just a beginning of a great experience. The Peninsula, Hong-Kong is one of those grand hotels that we all loved. Upon arrival the hotel manager meets you at the door to directly take you to your room where you sign the registration. The view of the bay from the junior suite is breathtaking, especially during the nightly laser show. We hope to return to Peninsula next time we visit HK. Highly recommended."
224,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Peninsula Pinnacle,"The pinnacle of our recent luxury hotel discovery tour would have to be the Peninsula in Hong Kong. This really is a 7 star Hotel in every way, from the majestic grand foyer to the plush technology equipped suites...and the pool is to 'dive' for! Our room had magnificent views of the Harbour and afforded us front row seats for the 8:00 pm light show every night. Our breakfast was sensational, made even more special by bumping in to an international artist whilst browsing the fruit and waffle bar.
The high tea is still incredibly popular due to the beautifully tiered platters of savoury and sweet delicacies.The attention to detail across the board really sets this establishment apart.
The staff await your every need or whim...definitely a notch above camping, so save your pennies and experience something very special."
225,Date of stay: November 2014,50,"WOW, what a hotel!","As you can see in my other TripAdvisor-ratings, I am fortunate to have visited quite a few five-star-hotels, but this is definetly among the best.
Super helpful staff (as you would expect from a hotel in this class), but is seems that the staff gives just a little extra.
The facilities at the hotel is just super. DO NOT miss the rooftop terrasse by the pool. Have a nice cold beer (beer stays cold in the special water cooled glass!!) while looking at the Hong Kong skyline.
I have never been in a hotelroom with so many gadgets (including my visit to Burj El Arab in Dubai). Temperature, curtins, tv, radio and much more are controlled by the two tablets in each room, super cool.

We did not eat at the hotel, but we found a very nice terrace-restaurant (no view) korean restaurant called ""Maru Korean Rest. & Bar"" in Cameron Street five minutes walk from the hotel. They have the kitchen open untill 04am every day. Expect a nice young atmosphere, and I dage you: try one of the dishes with two chillies...complete burnout, nice!!!!

If you are planning a visit to Hong Kongs tallest building, The iCC harbour (Kawloon side). You can enjoy a dinner in one of the five restaurants just behind the huge building. We went for a burger in the burger joint. It was super.

My last tip: if you want a great view of the skyline, go to Wooloomaloo-rooftopbar (31th floor) in Wan Chai (Hong Kong island ). Nice atmosphere and free admission. See
http://www.wooloo-mooloo.com/hk/wan-chai.aspx

And yes, there is free high speed internet all over the hotel!"
226,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Take the rooftop helicopter to the airport!,"Super hotel with the highest standards throughout. My room was spacious and very well appointed with luxury & every convenience. If you dont travel by chopper from the rooftop to the airport you could always take one of their fleet of Rolls Royce cars there instead!

Really pleasant spa area with great service as elsewhere in the hotel. Its not the lowest priced hotel in HK, but you will enjoy your stay...."
227,Date of stay: November 2014,40,Not as good as it was,"i have stayed in this hotel for at least twenty years , never even thinking of an alternative .

The best experience was the usual pick up at the airport and delivery back by their Phantom Rolls Royce. NOT ONCE DID ANYONE GREET ME AS I Entered the hotel there was no hotel butler service on the floor the charming tray of soaps to chose from as one checked into the room .
In all an excellent hotel which has lost its special guest service making one feel special . The lobby is the same and the property is still one of the finest in Hong Kong .probably stay again but with no great expectations as I always had in the past .

Disappointed !"
228,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Classy Dame,"I stayed here for 2 nights in November, something I have always wanted to do. I was not dissapointed with my stay. Staff/room/food superb. I even got a little cake as it was my birthday treat for staying at the hotel.

Worth every penny spent, the rooms are spacious and spotless, you have to do afternoon tea, no visit can complete without doing that.

As Arnie says ""I'll be back"""
229,Date of stay: September 2014,50,One of the Best in the World,"Don't let the chaos in the lobby deter you. The history and reputation of this iconic grande dame makes the lobby a tourist destination with Gawkers milling about at peak tourism times. But, the minute you get in the elevator as a guest (hotel keys required), you are transported to the fairy tail cocoon you imagined it would be. Unparalleled gentile service, views of the beautiful Hong Kong skyline from your hotel room, the breakfast room, and the beautiful Roman bath style indoor pool equipped with seated dining service, and the fine dining venue. Exotic cozy bars you could easily see in a movie with the leads enjoying a romantic tryst....shaken, not stirred...including an exotic dark tiny bar in the basement, you enter through curtains, where on a given eve, a local siren is crooning... Or the piano bar upstairs.....Bogey must have been here! The newly renovated rooms are beautiful, comfortable and extremely modern while maintaining a sophisticated oriental feel. The breakfast buffet is wonderful, with so many options, you will not tire of visiting every morning. The Rolls Royce pickup is more than worth the slight up charge from a regular car. You are whisked through customs with assistance and relaxing in the stretch Rolls within a few short minutes....enhancing the fairy tale experience. If you can, you must stay here at least once in your life while visiting Hong Kong. It is a short walk to the Star Ferry, which will transport you in minutes to tourist destinations in and around the central business district. Only negative is for CBD fine dining destinations, this might be a little uncomfortable in heels and more formal attire, requiring a longer cab ride into town through busy traffic. A small price to pay. My husband and I have travelled to many destinations and stayed in fine hotels around the world, including Paris, Monte Carlo, Florence, Rome, Istanbul, to name a few, and this hotel is easily in the top 3, of all thus far."
230,Date of stay: November 2014,40,2 night stay,"Had a chauffeur driven car from the airport to the hotel which meant as soon as you landed airside a member of the hotel was waiting for you to guide you thru passport control and collect your luggage then drive you to the hotel
Room was very good as was breakfast and the hotel lived up to its star rating
Had dinner in felix beautiful view of the harbour great food but not cheap but worth it"
231,Date of stay: November 2014,50,"Was, Is & Always Will Be Great!!","The Peninsula is a world class, great hotel, and, in my mind, the only place to stay in Hong Kong. It is both classic, having been in existence a long time, and totally up to date, with modern facilities, updated rooms with todays' technology, and an elegance which blends the best of old and new.

The Harbour views are spectacular, and upgrading to a Harbour view is worth every penny.

The staff are extraordinary & special thanks go to Michelle (front desk), Rick & Vincent (1st floor restaurant) and Flo & Brian (Concierge desk).

The breakfast in the 1st floor restaurant is wonderful and Felix (the top floor restaurant) is not to be missed for the magnificent views (insist on a window table), excellent dishes, and superb service. We ate at a number of top rated restaurants in HK and enjoyed our evening most at Felix. Thanks to Daniel and his staff for an unforgettable evening.

And.....tea in the Peninsula Lobby is a happening, and an old British tradition that is executed with style.

Even the shopping mall is fabulous with both virtually every major brand represented and some excellent local retailers, with special excellence in ultra fine jewellery,.

All told....a great hotel which exceeds most expectations"
232,Date of stay: November 2014,50,beautiful hotel outstanding service,"beautiful hotel , outstanding service. very impressed and highly recommend this hotel. the lounge downstairs is the perfect place to have dinner, drinks or just relax. the staff are very attentive to your needs and request. its a world class hotel.highly recommend."
233,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Stunning,"When I lived in Hong Kong I walked by this hotel on many occasions and on rainy days would occasionally pop in. It was impressive and I thought about eating there but the budget I was on forbade it.

Well, now that I return on my own dime it is time to splurge and this is one of the best splurges. The hotel looks familiar to James Bond fans as do the green Rolls Royces. It is located in TST on the Kowloon side.After the 2012 makeover the rooms are all very up to date but the classic lobby looks much the same.I ate at Gaddi's and Fenix.

If you are a ""Dark Night"" fan make sure and go see the heliport!

Although I wish my business travel allowed me to stay here on every visit, the rooms start at more than 500 USD daily and go way up from there. A friend arranged to show me the Penninsula Suite. Wow. http://hongkong.peninsula.com/en/room-types/the-peninsula-suite"
234,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Certainly Old World,This was our first stay at this hotel. Old world and a bit stuffy. Rooms were perfect and very high tech. The lobby always seemed cluttered with food being served all day and night. The hotel lacks nothing with many restaurant choices and a bar with a view. Their breakfast was beautiful. We liked the hotel.
235,Date of stay: February 2014,50,"Amazing hotel - take yourself back to the ex-pat lifestyle of the 30""s","We stayed here both on the way to and the way from Thailand. This hotel is amazing and you need to experience it at least once in your life. The experience started with a chauffeur picking us up at the airport in a Rolls-Royce. To be fair we didn't touch our baggage at all from the point we checked into London to when it turned up in the room. Afternoon tea is a wonderful experience with a string quartet playing on the Balcony - while you eat your English Cream Tea, This is the sort of luxury and experience it's really quite difficult to find. The Felix Restaurant on the top floor was one of the best meals I have ever had and the view through the solid glass wall onto the Harbour was astounding. Go on - you know you want to!"
236,Date of stay: November 2014,50,The Perfect City Hotel,Stylish without being painfully trendy and the best use of technology controls in a room I have ever seen. Impeccable service and old school charm. The only fault I could possibly find is that the doormen could be a little more attentive.
237,Date of stay: November 2014,50,Absolutely perfect!,"The best luxury city hotel! We have stayed at some iconic hotels in Europe, US and Asia, but have never seen anything so perfect in terms of the room, the service and the technology. In the four nights we stayed there we couldn't find a single thing that was out of place. We stayed in a deluxe suite, it was unbelievably large for a city like HK and beautifully laid out. Every room was equipped with a tablet which controls everything in the room and it worked beautifully, in most other hotels they have these fancy stuff, but most dont work. There were so many little things like chargers, hide away mirrors etc that are placed perfectly for use. There was even a VOIP on the phone that was so convenient to use for free calls, never seen this anywhere before!The staff is extremely efficient, nothing was delayed, even our sudden requests were addressed. The concierge worked extra hard to get us a table at a top restaurant at short notice. Peninsula has clearly redefined luxury for us...absolutely perfect and simply the best!"
238,Date of stay: November 2014,50,No issues! Wonderful stay!,"When the biggest complaint you have about a hotel is its driveway they have done something right! Great spacious room. Beautiful! Bathroom was great, closets space was great. Bed was huge, nice ipad system to operate the whole room from the comfort of your bed. Pool was awesome. Always warm, service was great and what a view! Great location also right next to train station and harbor! Can't wait to come back!"
239,Date of stay: November 2014,50,"Impeccable,Incredible...Perfection","From the minute Matteo(assistant front desk manager) checked me in and escorted me to my room to show me how everything worked to the last minute of my stay , I could find only perfection down to the last detail . I have stayed in some really top of the like hotels worldwide but this one comes in first place by a long shot . The room was beautiful, comfortable, pristine with every amenity one could ask for..including multiple cords to charge any time of smart phone , electronic panels and tablets to control all room items like the air temp, the lights, curtains, tv etc

The drawers and cabinets were a beautiful black lacquered wood with leather coverings, nespresso machine , all stationary and office items, all bathroom amenities . The room was large and the king sized bed was lush .

The service in the lobby restaurant, the verandah restaurant where I ate most of my meals including afternoon tea was also perfect in every way, down to every last detail. As soon as I was done eating each plate , the server was there picking it up ..the food was incredible down to the last bite . The breakfast buffet was one of the best I've ever had and I ate there everyday at the Verandah Restaurant .... Plus the views
The spa, the fitness center , the pool and the ladies locker area were phenemol... Again the service was beyond expectations and exceeded any desire I have ever had. In the ladies locker area, the attendants offered different oils for the steam room depending on how I felt at that moment. The pool was stunning with breathtaking views behind the floor to ceiling glass windows. WOW!
Most importantly were all the concierge staff, they were amazing...each and everyone of them helped me everyday and all day and with such kindness and personal touches . They were friendly and professional and very detail oriented .. I don't know if there is any other hotel in the world that could beat this staff, I bet against it.
Last but not least was Matteo who assisted me from check in and made sure to greet me everyday as if I was just a regular at the hotel. He was kind, patient, professional and very serious about his job by making sure my every need was met. At one point I needed to know where a certain store was down the street, he came out and escorted me around to the arcade hallway and to the back door to make sure I knew exactly where I was going. Matteo went above and beyond my every expectation and he maintained the utmost professionalism on a daily basis and did not waiver from perfection. I hope the efforts of Matteo and the entire concierge staff get plenty of recognition. They all deserve it. Everyone in the hotel, including the gentleman in white uniforms opening the front lobby doors performed in the highest regard. This was certainly an experience of a lifetime and one I will never forget"
240,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Dream hotel .,"We stayed an amazing 9 nights here and enjoyed every minute of it.The weather in October was sunny and hot and allowed us everything we wanted and more. The Concierge desk were so helpful and professional that trips were made with ease.The view from the room was inspirational and at night even more so.Afternoon tea and indeed all the meals in the hotel were by far the best in the city and of course the decor and history just makes it.This hotel Definately ranks along with The Oriental,Bangkok and Raffles ,Singapore as the best in the Orient!"
241,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Unbeatable,"We have been to Hong Kong several times but until now have never been able to afford to stay at the Peninsula. We have often sat in the vaulted lobby and drunk a cocktail wondering what it might be like to stay. That prospect beckoned distantly but when at last the opportunity came for us to stay for five nights, we seized it, wondering if the experience would be worth the not inconsiderable cost.

It was worth every cent and more, simply to experience an incomparable sense of being pampered at every turn.

The exquisite service began with the Rolls Royce limousine transfer from the airport. This is not just a limo ride. The service began as we stepped out of the airbridge, from which we were whisked by buggy to immigration. Our bags were lifted from the carousel for us and carried to the Rolls Royce. We literally did not see them until we arrived in our room, where they awaited us. The trip from the airport to Kowloon was an experience in whisper-quiet transportation with soft Italian ballads playing in the background. Our delayed late night arrival could not have been made more easy.

Our room was in the original building and so had a high ceiling and attractive scale. The appointments are simply stunning and the bathroom is a delight of clever design and old fashioned luxury. We swam every day in the sumptuous pool area where access to the spa to change is gratis and attendants can arrange breakfast if you desire.

Dinner at Gaddi's was a wonderful evening of fine French dining and dancing, serenaded by a cocktail trio of rare talent. The Verandah buffet dinner was a wonder of small dishes, all of which would have qualified for Michelin star status anywhere else. Afternoon tea was the tradition it promised. A table can be booked for afternoon tea by guests of the hotel (but others must queue and there are many who do). And breakfasts were a delight of beautiful dishes and delicious tea served in solid silver pots.

If you must venture out (and this is the only hotel we have ever stayed in that makes this a real question) the hotel is in prime position next to the harbour, ferries, MTR station and Kowloon shopping. An entrance to Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station is immediately behind the hotel and the station concourses offer a subterranean air conditioned alternative to walking above ground for quite a distance around the lower part of Kowloon.

Each room in the hotel has its own attendant (a kind of semi-butler) and there are deft little touches such as a drop box which allows laundry and shoes to be left for pick up without the need to be disturbed in the room. Laundry returned to the room comes in a beautiful lacquered box topped with an orchid. This is also the only hotel known to offer a built-in nail dryer, for those needing to harden their manicure polish!

For guests required to work, the desk area is cleverly laid out with built-in adapter plugs and all the equipment you may need, including a wireless printer should you need to print documents from your computer. The bedside table has a drawer in which a set of all standard phone chargers is permanently tapped into the power supply, in case you mislay yours. The room is equipped with VOIP telephone so that long distance calls are without cost and you can avoid the need to account to your home mobile carrier as well.

We could go on endlessly, but the final note is on cost. For an unparalleled experience the cost was high, but not so high as to make this an unattainable luxury. We will be saving our pennies because a week at the Peninsula Hong Kong is, well, a slice of hotel paradise."
242,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Service at it's best,Never have I been so keen to write about a stay I've had at a hotel. I have been fortunate enough to stay in some great hotels but the Peninsula Hotel's service was simply the best I have ever experienced. The experience starts as soon as you check in to the hotel and from there it never stops. We were in Hong Kong to celebrate my daughter's 8th birthday. When we arrived there was a birthday cake awaiting her in the room and of course some candy. It was also halloween and she was invited to a halloween party organised by the hotel where she was pampered and treated like a princess. This was an amazing stay and a special thanks goes out to Henri and Keiko.
243,Date of stay: July 2014,50,Truly experience luxury!,"I fall short of words to describe how impeccable the hotel was. It screams luxury, class and a certain old world charm that is hard to find even in the most prestigious hotels. The hotel is itself has a history that dates almost 100 years and is popular for various traditions like the afternoon tea (which is a touristy thing to do by itself).

The rooms were designed with thought, care and consideration. They are extremely spacious- huge king size bed, study desk and a dressing table with additions like a nail paint dryer and dressing mirror. These things makes you happy! Then there are all the gadgets placed in the room for guests convenience like tablet synced everything (from lights, temperature to room service and concierge) truly eliminating the need to call up the front desk! And then there is the bathroom which is what bowled me over. There is a separate shower cubicle and WC as well as a bath tub. Like all Peninsulas the toiletry is from Oscar de la Renta and is just smashing.

The pool and the gym both are on the top floor of the main building, overlooking the harbour and provides fantastic views of the skyline in the evening. The pool area itself (though not open air) is very tastefully done up.

The service is extremely good, staff courteous and more than willing to help. Its also very well located. Attractions near by include the Space and Art Mueseum, Avenue of Stars, Tsim Tsa Sui MTR station, Star Ferry terminal and shopping options plenty."
244,Date of stay: October 2014,40,Iconic hotel with poor breakfast experience,"Peninsula is one of the iconic hotels in Hong Kong. Hotel has excellent location close to all attractions and Star Ferry. The lobby and all other public areas are nice and well maintained.
We stayed in a room with stunning harbour/ Hong Kong Island view. Our room was big enough with comfortable bed, nice decor and high quality materials ( wood, leather and marble ), it was very well equipped including 3D tv and 3D blu ray player with movie library.
Room service was very good. We used airport RR transfer which offers not only smooth and comfortable trip in a legendary car but also baggage assistance in the airport. I highly recommend.
Unfortunately I can not recommend breakfast. We had buffet breakfast in Verandah cafe ( breakfast a la carte is available in the lobby as well ). First of all restaurant/hotel accepts guests in sportwear - I saw few people with shorts, sneakers and white socks who looked like they came directly from the gym which doesn't really match elegant decor and atmosphere of Verandah cafe. Secondly it was very busy and we had to wait for a table. I travel a lot and to be honest it was the first time in my life I had to wait for a table - being a hotel guest. I had to ask for my eggs 3 times until I got them. When I asked for sweet chilly sauce for spring rolls - they didn't kńow what I was talking about and they brought 3 completly different things. The food selection was OK but nothing to die for, very poor bread selection ( and poor quality as well ). All together I didn't really enjoy the breakfast and can not recommend it."
245,Date of stay: October 2014,10,What a mess !,"I have stayed at top hotels around the world . Park Hyatt - Vendome , St, Regis Rome , Four Seasons Hualalai .Ritz Motreal , ETC . I booked this hotel through Amex Platinum program for November .I have received emails from Mandy Wong , Leo Ho and and Vincent Lim !
They all have different answers . There are no consistency .
They told me that Amex platinum benefits are not accurate . It would be not honors .
If you are busy person and wants luxury on your vacation .
I would recommend four seasons or Mandarin Orienta for Hong Kong :)"
246,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Impeccable,"I stayed 3 nights at the Peninsula this past October. I had stayed there a number of times, but not in a couple of years. The room and the service were near perfect. I had always loved the old world charm of the rooms which had high ceilings and were decorated in soothing beige with black lacquer cabinets and large beds. But my room this time had a number of touches that anticipated needs----a drawer next to the bed had a charging center with chargers for every type of device, ipads on either side of the bed had controls for curtains/lights/privacy/alarm as well as lists of services, alarm and menus, nespresso machine (I asked for extra pods one day and was provided extra pods for each day of my stay without my asking), waffle weave robes in addition to terry robes, much larger selection of TV channels than last time, office needs (fax machine, desk items, stationery), multiple outlets for plugs.

Other notes about the service:

1. My bags were in my room before I had finished check-in
2. Tea arrived almost immediately after I got to my room
3. I had left something behind and the day after I checked out, I received an email about it. It was put in the post that day.
4. Fruit was replenished every day.
5. I had left a headset in my room. I was informed the day after I checked out and it was mailed to me so that I had it by the time I returned to the US.

If I had to point out any deficiencies, it would be that there is no list of wines available on the room service menu. I had to call to get a list of wines by the glass and the list was very short."
247,Date of stay: September 2014,50,It's a Must,Heading to The Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong for High Tea is just one of those things you MUST do when you visit the city. We had a 45 minute wait for the table but it was well worth it. The food and service were superb and you feel really special being in such gorgeoous surrounds. Thoroughly recommended.
248,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Fit for a king or 3,"I write a lot of hotel reviews and people often ask me what my bench mark is - well this is it.

I have been coming to the Pen for several years now and have also stayed at such icons as the Ritz Paris, Hotel Baeur Grumwald Il Palazo Venice and the Palace New York. The Pen leaves them all for dead.

If you want to experience true luxury and service than this is it. From the Rolls Royce transfer to the luxury of the Spa and the sheer elegance of the lobby this hotel never disappoints.

On this quick stop, the hotel staff detected we were returning guests and a signed card and chocolates awaited us in our room from the hotel manager.

The staff address you by name and many just know us and are always so kind.

This is a faultless hotel and once you have stayed here it is difficult to stay anywhere else.

If you can afford it do yourself a favour and stay in this, the world's best hotel.

To Ms Chan and all her amazing staff - thank you for all your amazing service and sheer luxury."
249,Date of stay: November 2013,50,WOW - Deluxe Harbour View Suite,"Stayed here courtesy of friend's Amex Centurion promotion - and it is hands down the BEST hotel experience any of us had so far. The suites is a massive room that's larger than 90% of the homes in Hong Kong, fitted out with top quality and tasteful deco (e.g. the corner spa bath overlooking the harbour, walk-in robes, multi-adapter phone charge points, Focal headphone, etc - the list goes on and on).

It's also one of the rare instances where the hotel website / photos do not do the actual room justice - the suite turned out to be much larger and impressive.

Definitely highly recommended and would return (when I can afford it myself)."
250,Date of stay: November 2013,50,I want to be there right now...,"It all began with an airport greeting by a host to direct us through immigration who then handed us off to another to collect our bags and steer us through a separate exit to our waiting Rolls Royce limousine. While my husband took advantage of the WiFi and we appreciated the lights of the city during the thirty minute commute, I had a tear or two, feeling so fortunate. Whisked through the lobby for in-room registration, upgraded to a stunning room, we were oriented to such amenities as an office desk (including FAX, Peninsula Post-Its, a highlighter and every size paperclip, as well as the more mundane pens, paper, etc.); Bose equipment (earphones in each underlit bedside table and surround sound), a makeup table with a mirror that was both perfectly lit and retractable, coasters that slid out of the arms of the loveseat, along with every other detail one would expect in a five star accommodation. Just inside the entrance to the room was a door beneath the well-appointed luggage rack and wardrobe. It was within this cubicle that our morning paper arrived and when I placed laundry there and sent an alert via one of three IPads stationed throughout the room to fulfill one’s every wish, it was whisked away and returned later that day. The small pieces were folded in tissue paper, delivered in a beautiful leather case adorned with an orchid. Those little services made me so happy. Oh, and might I add it was the Best Bed Ever which made getting up in the morning a necessary challenge."
251,Date of stay: July 2014,50,What a great experience in hotel !;),"There is nothing bad I can say about the hotel. It a fabulous hotel great with location, setting and service. When I dun know how to change the TV channel to englishl, I can found the staff easily and just take a min , and they can help me change to english channel quickly!Also,the sleep is good, the rooms is spacious. The free wifi is great and the shower area is fabulous! There is no noisy aircon, bad sound proofing of door and they even have a free smartphone for you to use (it includes free data, free calls etc).
Everything is perfect! I would definitely be going back there again!"
252,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Perfection!,"This may be the best city hotel we have ever stayed in. Although the room was not especially large, it was so well thought out and appointed that made it especially comfortable. The service in the hotel was flawless and the concierge desk outstanding. The pool is large and quiet as it is reserved for hotel guests only.
Wait until you have the breakfasts or the afternoon tea- bliss"
253,Date of stay: October 2014,50,You have to do it once,"The peninsular hotel Hong Kong is a hotel I have wanted to stay in my whole life. And I was not disappointed a true Grand Dame!! The check in easy. The room with a harbour view incredible. I am always weary of too much technology in a hotel room , this room was tecked up to an inch of its life , but all so easy to use. The Afternoon tee a treat, the Buffet restaurant one of the best I have had. Would I stay in this hotel again? NO I wouldn’t . They problem with these “famous” hotels is that they are a tourist attraction. The foyer was like a train station with the amount of people. The hotel had no outside space to sit , drink and enjoy. I am so glad I stayed there everyone should once. However I do think the Four Seasons has the edge."
254,Date of stay: October 2014,50,Best hotel in asia?,"Being a regular traveller I set the bar higher than most people but I must say that there was not a single thing during the visit that I was not happy with.

Room was spacious and the bed was comfortable, unlike most hotels the air conditioning controls worked and I was able to chill the room down to a comfortable temperature to sleep in.

Free wifi and IP phone were a nice bonus, I asked for an ironing board and iron and it appeared in only a few minutes, a pleasant change from my experience.

Breakfast in the veranda restaurant was included and had a great range of breakfast options, service attentive but not intrusive.

I had lunch in the lobby restaurant and service and food was good also.

Bill was a bit on the high side but when you compare the hotel to its peers The Savoy and Browns in London and other truly great hotels it was competitive.

Definitely will make this my base for future trips to Hong Kong."
255,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Best hotel I ever stayed in.,"This hotel has everything one can expect from a 5 star hotel.

From when they pick you up (in style with RR) till you leave total service.

The rooms have everything you want. (Printers, audio/TV. etc)

Great bed!"
256,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Perfect - Faultless,"The Peninsular was the first stop on my six week retirement holiday - a perfect start to a special holiday .

We arranged to Rolls Royce transfers to make the start of the holiday extra special - oh what a treat with door to door care with being met as we got off the plane with a buggy taking us to baggage claim then an agent escorting us through to the car - what a treat ;)

On arrival our check in was done in our third floor corner suite .

The suite was spacious and with everything one would want .

Included in our booking was breakfast as well as a three hour use if the town car and driver . Just the best breakfast and the car was excellent to see some of Hong Kong .

Service at the Peninsular is extraordinary .

The Peninsular is a must in a lifetime but we will be back again ;)"
257,Date of stay: September 2014,50,What can you say?? Luxury Hotel...,"This hotel is spectacular. The staff, the food, the service. Stayed here with two kids. Breakfast was complimentary and offered a large selection - all the food was great! Loved the tea service. You honestly cannot ask more from a hotel than this. If you want to indulge, stay here.... Convenient location, close to MRT and ferries and numerous restaurants just up the road."
258,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Luxury of the highest order...,"I have had a fortunate year; staying in some of Asia's finest properties.
When the reputation of a hotel is as legendary as The Peninsula Hong Kong there is always pre-arrival trepidation - will the reality meet the mark - our stay here did indeed. This is a property for your bucket list.
We enjoyed three (child-free) nights in a harbour facing, corner Suite; on the 3rd floor of the original building. This is where I would request to return to again and again.
Hotel facilities are superb (the only blight was the renovation of the pool deck meant we had to lounge out on the gym deck - the positive flip side is that it will be all spanky new for our next visit). All staff were fabulous - on the Concierge desk they secured restaurant tables at a moments notice and gave great recommendations for tailors.
We had brunch at The Verandah (perfect); gin and tonics from the specialist trolley in The Lobby (must try); as the Typhoon started to blow outside we had room service and a movie (the BEST club sandwich and fries) - there are many more options to easily fill a longer stay (indulge at the chocolate room - go for the Haute Cuisine handmade options).
My parting note is that I discovered a NAIL DRYER in the bedroom - along with the Oscar de la Renta bathroom amenities; and the stunning daily fresh florals - luxury of the highest order!"
259,Date of stay: October 2014,40,Fantastic room rest no so,"Stayed 1 night. Arrived early, staff courteous and friendly, the laid out a small breakfast in the room which was very nice touch. The room itself is very intuitive, plug sockets and chargiers in abundance. They have clearly
thought of the business traveller. Had a light lunch at the cafe (light as in small portion). The issue I had was the constant interruptions whilst working in the room from staff coming and going on the clean up. Also I arrived back late last night. Asked if a pressing service was available (11pm) so my suit could be ready for the morning. Told it was 24 hours. Even this is declared on the form. So bundle suit in the bag and put in the valet box. Them 30 mins later a knock on the door asked if pressing could be done by 7.30. I said I was leaving at 6am. They went away only to return another twenty minutes later to be told pressing not available. Only open at 7am. Despite being informed by concierge and on the forms.

So took crumpled suit out. Called shangri la hotel my next stop and they informed me they could express on arrival. Guess where I am staying next time in Hong Kong"
260,Date of stay: September 2014,50,What an oasis - awesome!,"We unexpectedly ended up at the Peninsula after Tom was denied boarding by Cathay Pacific because his passport did not have three empty visa pages (had 1 visa, 2 amendement/endorsement pages). Argh! Stuck in HK with no HK money (which we had spent down thinking we would be in Bali in a few hours), no assurance that we would get the passport issues resolved in time to get to Bali (forsaking our wonderful Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay reservations), and potentially losing our business class seats. HK was a steam bath, we were frazzled from quickly getting a SIM chip for a phone so we could call the US consulate, hiring a car/driver to take us to the consulate, getting more HK money, trying to figure out what to do while we waited for the passport to be ready for pickup later that afternoon. We decided to make lemonade from the lemon situation and when I saw that the Peninsula had rooms we booked it. We straggled into the reception area sweaty, upset, tired, hot, dressed like we had just come off a safari (khaki travel vest and shlumpy airline travel clothing, backpack suitcases (because we left the big stuff at the airport) and totally frazzled. From the moment we stepped through their doors our burdens were lifted. They greeted us as graciously as the other bejeweled, beautifully coiffed and dressed other guests. Repeated assurances that they would take care of things. Suggested we wait in the lobby and have lunch while our room was being readied. Charged up my cell phone (which was nearly empty since I hadn't expected to use it). When shown to the room, we collapsed in relief, then explored the many amenities including the TV in the bath tub area, Star Trek like control iPad by the bed, the complete charging station in the pull out bedside drawer with every imaginable cable (micro, mini, standard USB, phone jacks, etc), the printer/fax, nail dryer!, etc. A staff person brought in a pot of welcome tea in beautiful china. The entire room was beautifully furnished and designed (doors didn't bump in to each other, light switches were placed appropriately so you could shut the bathroom door before turning it on so you didn't awaken the other sleeper. We showered, changed, felt like new people before returning to the consulate for the passport (hooray, only a one day delay and not all weekend! Thank goodness it was Friday and the consulate staff was sympathetic to our situation and tacked Tom on despite a full schedule and no appointments left), then back to the Peninsula for afternoon tea. The Peninsula totally restored us and turned an awful situation into a wonderful situation. Just goes to show that throwing money at problems WILL solve them. The Peninsula certainly lived up to their reputation. I'm only sorry we couldn't stay longer."
261,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Superb,"A wonderful experience. Classic hotel, beautifully appointed rooms with everything you could need, welcoming fruit and chocolates, excellent service from all staff we encountered. Our suite had fantastic views of the harbour and easy to use smart electronic controls for everything. Although the lobby always seemed busy the hotel was very quiet elsewhere. Enjoyed the best hotel breakfast ever on the Verandah and the pool area was great with the service and facilities of a private club. The afternoon tea and the Rolls Royce airport transfer just added to the experience. Loved it."
262,Date of stay: September 2014,50,High Tea a Treat,So many people have said we must have High Tea at the Peninsula. We did and it did not disappoint. Our hotel made reservations for us so we didn't have to wait in line. Definitely would recommend as part of your Hong Kong Experience.
263,Date of stay: September 2014,30,Not even the best in Hong Kong....,"Disappointing. Forget being the best hotel in the world. This is not even the best in Hong Kong. Even prior to check in we had an excruciatingly tedious experience with the Spa staff who showed not an ounce of common sense and flexibility. Check in was embarrassingly slow, and when our room wasn't free 1 hour before check in (despite plenty of availability on the web-site of equivalent rooms) we were invited to wait in the lobby and have an early lunch. Judging by other reviews on this site this appears to be a well thought out tactic by the hotel. When we then re-queued after lunch to compete check in we waited another 10 minutes.

Said lunch was poor. I tried to pre-empt some difficulty by repeating our lunch order to a plainly disinterested waitress 5 times (no exaggeration). Yes, she still got the order wrong. The order - the most complex part of which was a chicken Caesar salad - was abject.

Rooms were very well refurbed and I agree with other reviewers in saying that the fusion of modern technology and design makes for a high quality room. The most positive aspect of our stay.

The spa was ok. But lacking in space and double rooms and poorly configured- I can't believe I'm alone in wanting to be in the same room as my partner for a massage.

The indoor pool is very elegant and relaxing and the gym was well equipped. But again the poolside food was poor. My sushi tasted as though it was brought straight from the chilled shelves at the supermarket.

The complimentary champagne for our anniversary was a pleasant touch and the service in the helicopter waiting area was excellent.

Reverting to my original comment about local hotel competition. The best food? (equivalent HK hotel) - Four Seasons or Intercon. The best spa? Four Seasons or Landmark Mandarin. The best service? Nearly all 5 star equivalents. The best rooms? Maybe. But we got a complementary upgrade at the Upper House, when it wasn't our anniversary and that room was exceptional. And we will return to the Upper House.

Summary: Living on a tired/colonial reputation for a nostalgic memory of an afternoon tea. Thanks for the anniversary memories."
264,Date of stay: November 2013,10,"Yeah, right","The worst ""luxury hotel"" I have ever stayed in. Booked pick-up with the Rolls which was cheap and ancient, ugly car. Driver did not speak a word of English. Room with flower patterns, horrible. Lobby filled with tourists wanting to get pictures, staff seemed to care more about them than the hotel guests."
265,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Superb place to stay,"An experience not to be missed when in Hong Kong. Staff go out of their way to make everything perfect. I have stayed there twice and rooms were really something to write home about. The suite we stayed in had beautiful furniture, fantastic views of the harbour and electric everything. Of course the afternoon tea experience is also a must. Hotel even had a Rolls Royce pick-up service for us to get to the hotel - costs extra though. Love this hotel."
266,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Good not as good as it was!,"We had a lovely stay, the second time I had stayed , the last time was 35 years ago and I was in awe then as a youngster, the hotel is now so much bigger as it was the and I was smaller. Non the less a great stay and I will return. The tradition carries on ."
267,Date of stay: April 2014,40,Historic and classy,"Stayed in a suite, was very large and had complimentary fine chocolates, fruit, and tea upon arrival . We stayed in the older part of the hotel. It was nicely renovated but you can still see and feel the historic nature of this hotel. I Prefer modern but it was fine. Afternoon tea was okay, not as great as it hyped. I actually enjoyed the film on continuous loop on TV showing the history of the HK peninsula....very interesting. Was at the Tokyo Peninsula before coming to this hotel, so was a little let down bcs the tokyo peninsula was perfect to a t. But this one was good nonetheless."
268,Date of stay: September 2014,50,"Sets the benchmark for luxury, unobtrusive service and well-thought-out room amenities","The Peninsula in Shanghai has been the yardstick against which we measure all other hotels so we looked forward to seeing if the Hong Kong Peninsula would best it.

Our Peninsula experience started even before our arrival with several email exchanges to check on our bedding preferences (we decided on down pillows and duvet).

Our Superior Suite was on the fourth floor and had a spectacular view of the Victoria Harbour. At 86sqm, it had a good-sized bedroom with a separate living area. Our son's bed came complete with Peninsula Pagebear-motif sheets. Fluffy slippers, child toothbrush/toothpaste and a plastic cup were also thoughtfully provided.

Samsung Galaxy tablets control the room’s temperature, curtains, TV and lights. We were most impressed with the technology. It was user-friendly and intuitive without being intrusive. International phone calls are free if you use VOIP, and local calls are also FOC.

The TV can be controlled via the tablet or a remote control but we much preferred the remote to navigate through the huge selection of channels. On top of the local TV stations, China TV, and news stations, there were also free movie channels and international cable stations. WiFi is fast and unrestricted. You can connect up to 4 devices per room.

Our bedroom was luxuriously appointed with dark wood surfaces polished to a high shine. Unlike most hotel rooms, this one had plentiful storage space and a large walk-in closet. Also in the walk-in closet is a valet box that the housekeeper can access from the hallway without entering the room. Laundry was left in the box at 11.30am and was returned, impeccably folded and laundered at 6pm. Impressive.

The dressing table features an oh-so-cool retracting mirror that’s backlit. In the drawers are also a nail dryer and hairdryer. Bedside tables have charging stations with international outlets (no need for adaptors!), and USB and iPad/iPhone chargers. Here you’ll also find noise cancellation headphones and iPad extension cords.

In the living room, the study table was equipped with an all-in-one printer/scanner/photocopier. Naturally, you can expect a Nespresso machine, tea-making facilities, wine fridge, and mini-bar. Fresh fruits are replenished daily. Housekeeping was flawless.

The hotel also has some great restaurants. We ate at the Verandah for buffet lunch and The Lobby for high tea. Both were worthwhile experiences.

Our suite came with the use of a chauffeured Mini Clubman for three hours daily but with only two Minis available, you’re advised to book at 7am to ensure you can get hold of one.

The concierge team was enthusiastic and engaging. We particularly liked Sumie who was friendly, gracious and extremely helpful in assisting us with directions and in booking restaurants.

We shall be back for another stay at The Peninsula!"
269,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Most Elegant In Hong Kong,What an amazing hotel. Loved the tea time in the Lobby serenaded by live orchestra. Great location in center and next to harbor. Everything within walking distance. Great service. Amazing food. Clean rooms. Marvelous bathrooms. Loved the toiletries.
270,Date of stay: September 2014,30,Disappointed.... My third stay at The Pen and probably the last,"Being a native Hong Konger, a stay at The Pen conjures up images of colonial grandeur, opulence and pampering by a fleet of immaculately trained hoteliers. Well, the first two certainly still hold true, but this time I can't help but feel rather disappointed.

Over the years I let myself and my family indulge in the occasional luxury by booking a night at The Pen so we (with wife and two kids) can huddle up and enjoy some quiet moments. We loved it so much the first time that we return to relive the experience again and again. The hardware is undoubtedly top-notch. Our Courtyard Deluxe Room deserves a big ""thumbs up"", with what I can only describe as classy, supplemented with fancy yet practical high tech conveniences, delivered through the ingenious iPad. We loved swimming under the stars facing the million dollar harbour view. The bed is among the finest we've slept in. The rollaway bed is definitely the most comfortable we've ever had.

So why only three stars?

There was no ""wow"" factor, but the occasional ""u-oh"" moments. Checking in at 5pm wasn't exactly rush hour. There wasn't a line in front of me but all three receptionists were engaged. For some reasons those three guests took rather long to resolve their issues, so by the time I got to the counter it was 15 minutes later (while trying to control my kids from running around). The lady didn't say ""welcome to the Peninsula"" nor ""sorry to keep you waiting"" nor any pleasantries. It was just a curt ""you have a reservation with us?"" I can't say she was poorly mannered or unprofessional. But I had felt more warmth and welcoming checking into a Holiday Inn or Sheraton. You may say I'm picky, but for an establishment that prides itself with service, that certainly was far from impressive.

When I made the booking I told reservations that I was coming with my two children, and even emailed their ages for record. She said she would give them some ""treats"" for the stay. But alas while I was checking in the receptionist had to ask again for my kids' details, and I told her we had stayed there before and it should be in the records. Well, sure thing it was. Upon arriving at the room all I found was small jars of gummy bears and candy (which I admit were yummy). In my previous visits there were Peninsula teddy bears, colouring books and kids bathrobes and slippers. This time there was none. Perhaps it's just unfortunate that my previous experiences left a few ""wow"" moments which I came to expect this time round, only to be let down. So I just picked up the phone and called housekeeping to request for kids robes and slippers which sure enough were promptly delivered.

We went for a swim and ate dinner at poolside. Service there was excellent, though the quality of food was nothing to write home about (in fact my kids refused to take another bite of the spaghetti bolognaise for which I couldn't blame them). Later that night my wife ordered a sweet and sour soup through room service, and even though she was happy with the taste, the meager portion (despite the exorbitant charge) meant she didn't go to bed with a full stomach.

Well, the rest of the stay was rather uneventful. Check out was efficient, again without much warmth nor personal touch. But by then I had drawn my expectations down so much that I just assumed it was another Holiday Inn or Sheraton, even though the amount I was signing on the Amex chit denotes otherwise.

Perhaps it's time to look into the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. In a city where super five star hotels are in abundance, I'm sure I'll find the pampering at such level of pricing... A dieu The Pen!"
271,Date of stay: September 2014,50,A Pleasant Mid-Autumn Festival,"We celebrated the Mid-Autumn Festival there.
We stayed in a superior suite, it was big & comfortable. The decoration was delightful.
Having dinner at Gaddi's, the food was absolutely delicious. Moreover, we enjoyed the superb performance very much !
All the staff provided the high standard services. They were polite & helpful.
Luckily, 4 pieces of mooncake were delivered to our bedroom. Delicious & famous !
We did enjoy a pleasant night !"
272,Date of stay: July 2014,50,Superlatives are not enough !!,"Have stayed a few times in the Peninsula - in fact where else in HK would you stay ??

The hotel amenities and service are fabulous and really defy superlatives. Rooms with a harbour view are superb, both with the view of the harbour and the symphony of lights as well as the technology in the rooms allowing everything to be operated from an I-Pad. Restaurants are fantastic and what can you say about the Afternoon High Tea in the lobby - words are not enough to describe the service, selection of goodies, and location. If you have never been o the Peninsula you need o do so - it is truly one of the greatest hotels in the world."
273,Date of stay: August 2014,50,LOVE this place,"I stayed for four nights in August with a friend and loved every minute! The hotel oozes luxury and sophistication with a service level to match. The rooms are beautifully and tastefully decorated with an array of electrical gadgets (tablets to operate every possible function - tv, curtains, room service menu, lights etc. etc.), a beautiful marble bathroom with an amazing shower and plenty of storage, plus the all important nail dryer ;)
The beds were sublimely comfortable with fantastic linen and I slept sooo well!
Fresh fruit and water is provided every day, a helpful concierge sends messages via the fax, the drop box and also by voicemail ensuring you never miss a message! They are very helpful with restaurant recommendations / bookings and always followed up.
The breakfasts are amazing - what a great way to start the day, albeit bit cheaply! They are approx. £25 per person but the spread is all delicious with yummy pastries, fresh fruit, yoghurts, cheeses, cold meats, cooked station, Asian options and lovely coffee and juices. We didn't need lunch!
The spa is a wonderful place to take some time out of the hustle and bustle of HK and relax with great views over the harbour.
All in all a great stay and I would not hesitate to recommend or return."
274,Date of stay: September 2014,50,Pure Luxury,"What can one say about ""The Pen"". Its pure luxury that is what one can say.

From the moment we were greeted at the airport to the moment we returned to the airport, we were treated royally.

Check in was in the room and done in less than 5 minutes. Our room was a ""Deluxe Courtyard"" which gave us a bit of a view of Hong Kong harbor. The room was beautifully equipped, my other half was very happy to find the ""James Bond"" make up mirror, hairdryer and nail dryer all close to hand. The en suite was very nicely laid out and we had plenty of storage space for our 5 day stay.

The food was simply sensational. We dined at both Gaddi's and Spring Moon hotel restaurants. We also visited ""The Verandah"" for breakfast, buffet lunch and dinner several times.

The staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful at all times, whilst the Spa and Pool were excellent to laze away a few hours of the day.

""The Pen"" is simply pure class. Everything is done to perfection and nothing less than perfection is excepted or given.

My partner and I will be back for another visit soon, already we can't wait to see ""The Pen"" again."
275,Date of stay: September 2014,50,The best!,"I've stayed here lots and never tire of this beautiful iconic hotel offering amazing service and quality in accommodation. Truly one of the best hotels in the world. The newly refurbished central tower suites are stunning, ipad operated everything and it's so easy to use. Enormous rooms, excellent bedding and quality of mattress etc., our room was serviced three times daily and unobrusively. The shopping malls under the hotel are great as is the foyer restaurant and every other restaurant in this gorgeous hotel. Felix restaurant is outstanding, food and service of the highest calibre but the other restaurants are great also. It's in such a great location, close to Star Ferry and the enormous shopping malls."
276,Date of stay: May 2014,50,"Frequent visitor, will stay here for years to come","Traveling to China for business, weekends are spent in Hong Kong. I have been staying at The Peninsula for years, both before and after the renovations. And my colleagues have been staying here since the 80s and keep coming back.

By far, the best service of any hotel I have been to in the world. It's the little things that are back or mind but make the service by far above the rest. From the check in where the employees remember me (I would come about 8 times per year) to helping find things to do.

My colleague was very sick once and they sent a staff nurse to check on him and would call in the next few days as he recovered.

The rooms since the renovation are above the rest. Tablets for controls of the room from TV to menus to internet radio and controlling the lights and curtains.

Great location by Nathan Rd/Peking Rd and close to Harbor City and plenty of restaurants and the MTR (subway)."
277,Date of stay: August 2014,50,"Outstanding service, room and location","We stayed in a harbour view suite and it was amazing. Beautiful room and night view.
When we booked the room, we had to change the dates etc, but they responded our emails really promptely. THey are very helpful and polite too.
I cannot think of anything bad about it, we had great stay there!"
278,Date of stay: August 2014,40,Great hotel with a few minus points,"Stayed a night on 13th August as a treat for the family with three birthdays imminent, including my husband's 50th. Travelled as a family of 2 adults and 3 children (9,12 and 15). We were really looking forward to this stay as we had been in a cheaper hotel sharing a room for the past 3 nights!

We had booked two interconnecting Courtyard rooms. We arrived at around 11am hoping to make the most of our very brief time there but were told by the receptionist (who sounded Eastern European) on check-in that neither room would be ready before 2pm and one of them could be much later. She said that the hotel was full when we asked whether other rooms were available, and suggested that we wait in the lobby (more a dining area than seats with comfortable chairs and sofas) or go out shopping - the latter not especially helpful as the rain was torrential.

A quick look at the hotel website showed there were other courtyard rooms available so we told the same receptionist that we were prepared to take the non interconn rooms. As she started mumbling about it not being possible we were already wondering whether we had made the wrong move in not booking the Four Seasons. More helpfully she offered us the use of the swimming pool, but then another receptionist/manager intervened to apologise for the wait and offered us a suite that could be made ready asap. So we enjoyed a swim and poolside lunch (the first rate staff at the luxurious pool and spa restored our confidence in the Pen) then had a look at the 2nd floor suite. It wasn't quite as practical as a pair of interconnecting rooms, since it had only one bathroom (plus an extra loo) and could only accommodate two foldaway beds so we had to share our bed with our 9 year old. That said, it was pretty impressive: huge, impeccably clean with impressive chandeliers, sculptures and paintings, a great shower, latest tech gadgetries (including a bathroom TV with a waterproof controller in the bath) and had a glimpse view of the harbour. The housekeeping staff were great - nothing was too much trouble for them. Great too was the receptionist or manager who offered the alternative accommodation - the upgrade was nice but more importantly he acted quickly, thoughtfully and in the customer focused way that we would hope to take for granted in a deluxe 5* hotel. Husband received a lovely little cake and birthday card.

On checking out we were served by the same lady we encountered on check-in. The bill she prepared wrongly included extra charges for breakfast - she came up with reasons why this was so but husband patiently pointed out that breakfast was included in our package. Nevertheless we love the Pen despite some negatives mentioned, and we would really like to go back (have to start saving now :-)) when we return to HK next year."
279,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Excellent and unique hotel!,"The Peninsula is undoubtedly the hotel of Hong Kong and for good reason! The ambiance, the superb staff, great location make it the obvious choice amongst its rivals. Simply cannot imagine why someone would not chose the Peninsula if given a choice. Keep it up!"
280,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Outstanding,"From the moment your and and step into the Rolls Royce to ride to the Peninsula,you know you are for a treat. I have stayed two times in this hotel and it is one of the best hotels in the world. An experience maybe few hotels (the imperial at Vienna,or the Mandarin at Bankog) can match. It has very comfortable rooms with a great view to the bay,from we're you can enjoy the daily laser show at the other side. The club sandwich at the hotel lobby is the best in the world,and priced accordingly.
It has a good selection of restaurants,and shopping at the lower level.
The spa is world class,and the swimming pool has a stunning view of the bay
It's also conveniently near the ferry,were you can hop to the other side of the bay.
But primarily this is about service."
281,Date of stay: August 2014,50,The best hotel I have stayed in,"Staying here was absolutely amazing! The rooms are spacious and well furnished. The beds are soft and so comfortable that you can literally sink right into the mattress and feel nicely tucked in. There is even a wide variety of TV and movie channels to choose from. If there is a hotel that describes luxury, this is it.

Compliments to the friendly and professional staff who made my family's stay here an enjoyable and memorable one, and special thanks to Paul (the butler assigned to us) who made our Peninsula experience truly wonderful."
282,Date of stay: June 2014,50,wow...,My next stop in my trip was Hong Kong. Our suppliers brought us to the hotel from the airport. Check in was a breeze and the reception informed us one of their Rolls Royce cars will bring us at check out back to the airport. What a way to end a stay! My view was great of the room and nothing more to mention that this hotel even stands out more than what was a five star hotel in my book. I sampled all their restaurants and although pricey they absolutely match the quality on offering as well as the service. I had one waiter work at a restaurant for dinner and the next day while having lunch in the lobby he came up to me and asked me if all was to my likening. That's my felling of the property; staff being groomed to take care of customers to their best at all times.
283,Date of stay: August 2014,50,One of the best,"Style, class colonial heritage. Picked up by the rolls royce and driver. Corner room. Quite like having ypur own reception. Turn right to the lounge dining room left to your bedroom. Feels like home but 5 star. Amazing bathroom. Hong kong views at their absolute best."
284,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Queen of the Orient,"I have stayed at the Peninsula several times over the last 5 years. The experience starts at the airport when one is greeted at the flight gate and escorted through immigration to the Rolls Royce that will drive you to the hotel.

Rooms are large and well furnished and have now been refurbished and the become very high tech while retaining the old charms.

Will certainly stay here again. if you do then please experience the Peninsula Tea Time at lobby level.

Absolutely superior hotel."
285,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Amazing!,"Stunning! Beautiful from inside and outside.
This property it is an outstanding and remarkable demonstration of what Hospitality stands for.
I was impressed by the commitment and passion the the entire team from HK to Executive Office in pleasing myself.
Well done in several aspects.
LQA & LRA completely full score!"
286,Date of stay: February 2014,50,"It's not just a hotel, it is a Hong Kong's landmark.","One of the reasons we traveled to Hong Kong this time was to visit the recently renovated Peninsula, and we was not disappointed.

We booked a deluxe suite, and when my mom and I checked in a little bit before noon the suite was not ready ( and for us it was no problem) but a duty manager quickly offered us a few drinks and when we came back around 1.00 pm the room was still unclean so they went far beyond my expectation by offering a superb complimentary lunch at their Japanese restaurant which my mom enjoyed a lot. What a service!!

However, we later found the service to be a bit inconsistent, varied from the very professional staff at front desk and the smiling faces at the restaurants to some inattentive bell boys. This is a minor spot but I'd like to mention to the management since guests tend to expect a lot from the Peninsula.

In terms of hardware, the hotel and the suite were nothing short of spectacular - more than 120 sqm of living space with huge dining table and beautiful living area overlooking the Victoria harbor. The suite is tastefully decorated in every detail with the Peninsula's glamor , and it is also very well functioned to offer guests over the top comfort and please almost every need. My mom loves the hidden mirror , the custom nail dryer , the super high tech swishes and their iPads that controlled almost everything wirelessly. I do love the free movies on demand , the hidden power sockets and the free international calls. Well, they have done a great renovation job ,and undoubtedly, this renovation will easily keep the Peninsula as one of the world's most renown hotel for a long time.

Thank you the Peninsula, hope to see you again soon."
287,Date of stay: March 2014,50,What a truly outstanding experience....5-star in every way!,"My family and I (2 adults, 2 children aged 7 and 5) stayed at The Peninsula for the first time in March for 6 nights. We have been to HK twice before (both times for work) and stayed at a neighbouring property, but always made a promise to ourselves that if we were to come back to Hong Kong, we wouldn't stay anywhere else but The Peninsula. And boy, was it the best decision we ever made!! From the Rolls-Royce waiting for us at the airport, to the spectacular entrance of the hotel, to the in-room check-in, to every mod-con you could possibly imagine and much much MORE, there simply are not enough superlatives available to describe the magnificence that is The Peninsula Hong Kong. We stayed in 2 rooms: a Deluxe Harbour View Suite which interconnected with a Grand Deluxe Harbour View room....plenty of room for the 4 of us to relax and unwind! The rooms themselves are a sight to behold. Such luxury and refinement you have to see to believe. We LOVED the touchscreen tablets located all throughout the rooms, which enabled us complete control over everything from our room service selections to our curtains, and even our TV volume. Oh, and the TV's in the bath were a huge hit with our kids!!!!! The newly-renovated rooms are so indulgent and glorious that you could just sit in your room for hours enjoying your own private oasis and the magnificent harbour view. The pool area was completely divine, with such enormous, opulent columns and surroundings not normally found in big city hotels. The staff were always attentive to our needs (at times, a little TOO much so, as we started to feel a little uncomfortable that we allowed our children in the pool, despite them being on their best behaviour with no splashing our shouting!). Concierge were spot-on with all their restaurant and activity suggestions, and organising a chauffeured vehicle to transport us around HK was done with ease. Unfortunately we were unable to get into Felix as it was booked out, however we went to Spring Moon twice with our kids and the Peking Duck is something we will NEVER forget! Nor will we forget the once-in-a-lifetime experience of High Tea in the Lobby watching the world go by, or the exquisite daily breakfasts we had at The Verandah. The way the staff welcome you by name every time they greet you is truly impressive and sets them apart from many of their competitors. An extra-special mention goes to Guest Relations Executive, Henry, who went out of his way to ensure our stay was perfect in every way. From checking us in on our 1st night, to calling us throughout our stay to make sure everything was going well, to arranging for us and our kids to go on a behind-the-scenes tour of the hotel's Chocolate Room (wow wow wow!!), to even being there to say goodbye as we checked out of the hotel. So many special touches are just a given here: the children's welcome pack with their own teddy bears/slippers/robe/activity pack, daily fresh fruit and flowers, and the list goes on. Even though there is no Kids Club as such, our children were definitely welcome and there were plenty of things for them to do. The Space Museum was a huge hit and is literally right across the road, not to mention the Museum of Art, Ocean Park, The Peak and Disneyland.....a childrens' paradise! Would I recommend this hotel? A huge resounding YES! Is it expensive? OF COURSE it is, it's one of the finest hotels in the whole world, but it's an indulgence that everyone should have at least once in their life if they have the opportunity. So, all-in-all, one of the most amazingly memorable family holidays we've ever had. The property...the people...the sights...the hospitality....it all combined to make The Peninsula Hong Kong a 5-star experience in every way!"
288,Date of stay: August 2014,50,Oasis of luxury and comfort,"We had plenty of 5-star hotel choices in Hong kong but the Peninsula won based on its location (thank goodness it's not attached to a massive crowded mall) and our consistently favorable experience with other peninsula hotels.

What stands out about the Peninsula is the outstanding level of service. We stayed here for 5 nights, and by the second day, the waiters at breakfast knew our coffee and green tea preferences, as well as how we want our eggs cooked. At the spa, attendants prep the shower stall with towels before you use it, and would even dry spin your bathing suit for you. At the pool, I was surprised to find a refreshing glass of cold water and cold face towel waiting for me on my chaise lounge after my exercise laps. You don't have to ask and you don't have to lift a finger. Service is done to absolute perfection that only the Peninsula can deliver.

I like to describe Hong Kong as a crowded teeming city on retail steroids. The Peninsula was my oasis to escape the crowds, in the comfort of my own room, in lush comfortable beddings, and get pampered.

If there's one downside, i wish there were more comfortable sitting areas by the lobby where one can just relax, people watch, and enjoy the daily musical quartet. The only available sitting areas are tables for eating and afternoon tea."
289,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Buffet Visit,"A splendid trip to the Verandah restaurant, excellent food, excellent service with very attentive staff. Expensive service charge (10%) however. We also had to queue for the Oysters, quite a slow queue since they were freshly opened."
290,Date of stay: July 2014,40,Old luxury redefines!,"I have always wanted to experience the luxury of the Peninsula Hong Kong which was among the top notch hotels in HK. Prior to my arrival, I have been in contact with the concierge asking for their help in making restaurants reservation on my behalf, Flo Chan of the concierge responded promptly and had my wish fulfilled. Thank you very much for that! Comments from other reviewers have pretty much covered what I had to say about the luxury part, in short, this hotel lives up to its reputation. There are needs for improvement though, the janitors could be more friendly to the guests, a few of them never even greet us when met face to face along the corridor. The restaurant at the entrance was always full with people in the afternoon and crowded the lobby, this is simply not the right ambience for a luxury hotel! P/S: Every room is equipped with a wireless phone that can make free international calls using VOIP, you just have to dial ""001"" as prefix."
291,Date of stay: July 2014,50,Best hotel with great amenities,"My first time stay here for 3 nights has all but left great impression to my memory. Simply wow. The most impressive thing for the hotel is its unrivaled amenities in the room. Inside our room there are plenty of great surprises including automatic light and electronic control using ipad-type panel. The power outlets are everywhere and more importantly they have all kinds of connections and power outlet sockets that you could imagine. Simply say you don't have to bring any power socket when you stay here. The amenities also included not only hair dryer but also nail dryer! For the bed its quality simply suit me well with softness comfort and clean sheets. The room service also included free three pieces of clothes for pressing, which is a key service that i simply put high value on it as a business traveler. For the pool its appearance is majestic and so classic that you would feel in love at first sight. The service official at concierge has a highly respectful service mind. They offer a quick and efficient help to answer all our questions, book all of our requested bookings at many places, and provide materials and information that we needed. Lastly we loved the afternoon tea meal that we had for saying goodbye to the hotel. Its scone was delicious with signature tangerine tea. If you are the hotel guest you could get priority to book this afternoon tea."
292,Date of stay: July 2014,50,Top hotel with top service,"We stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong for 5 nights in July 14. The hotel is glamerous and service is at top levels.

We had a fantastic room in the old building on the 5th floor with quite a good view of Victoria harbour. The room is classic chic with all you can imagine. It's high tech and you can find just everything - even chargers for every kind of mobile device. The only let down was the two doors to the two rooms netx to ours. The insulation was very bad and you could hear just every noise from the rooms beside.

Breakfast was of very good choice and very nicely presented (on 1st floor). The pool area is superbly maintained with again very attentive service. Also the bar on level 1 was very nice and worth a visit - almost more than Felix on the top floor where blinds obstruct the view and there's not really a good choice of seats to enjoy your drink.

We had a wonderful stay - really enjoyed the grand old dame of Hong Kong. Will definitely return on another visit to HK."
293,Date of stay: July 2014,50,"Feels like coming home, the Pen never lets you down","This was our 4 th visit to this magnifcent hotel,
Front desk was very welcomimg and friendly.
Room was beautiful and every think was worked off a selection of ipad type machines.
Coffee machine also in room which wich was new to us . As it was myself and my husbands wedding anniversary we were delighted to recieve beautiful chocolate cake and champagne, totally surprised. Vanity mirror available at the press off a button .bathroom tv still there to the delight of my daughter. T V was great .
Felix bar view was amazing and cocktails good. Toilets very unusual but a great view.
Room service was amazing , we had it twice.
Breakfast was out of this world.
Staff very friendly and welcoming , always happy to please.
Pool staff amazing as was the ladies'in the changing room areas.
Spa = pure luxury ."
294,Date of stay: July 2014,50,The way a hotel should be,"We recently stayed at the Peninsula Hotel Hong Kong. Arriving at the airport I had pre-arranged to be picked up by one of the hotels 14 Peninsula green stretch Rolls Royces.. We were met at the Rolls upon arrival and were wisked to our suites. The rooms recently were renovated and are a techno marvel. The staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable. The pool was amazing with great views of Victoria Harbor. I had a problem with one of the stores in the lobby and hotel management came to my rescue. Afternoon tea was great and a must do, staff will make a reservation for you, and the breakfast buffett was not only a great deal but had a huge assortment of foods both western and asian. Will be back for sure."
295,Date of stay: May 2014,50,just a visit for afternoon tea.,"I can't review staying at the Hotel as we were staying at the Mandarin.The Hotel is very impressive, I have visited it before christmas and had the pleasure of seeing their amazing decorations. This time we went for their traditional afternoon tea - Hotel guests can book but not non residents - fair enough! we arrived at 2.45pm and it was packed, 5 groups in front of us but we were seated by 3.15pm. by 4.15pm the lines had stopped - so, go later if you don't want to wait to be seated. The 4 piece band playing on the mezzaine was delightful. Check out the wonderful shops on the lower level. The afternoon tea consisted of 2 scones, 3 finger sandwiches, 2 savoury pastries, 1 fruit bread slice, 4 delicate petite cakes plus jam and cream. We decided to add a few extra sandwiches but left some cakes untouched. You can order much less for a reasonable amount. My jasmine tea was really weak and almost cold - that's the only negative I can say about the experience - a must do in Hong Kong."
296,Date of stay: June 2014,50,The Grand Dame of the East,"While I did expect a good product from The Peninsula, this grand dame and her beautiful staff simply blew me away, climbing straight to the top of my rankings.
You see, it is very rare for a landmark property the size of The Peninsula to be able to to provide the levels of service usually associated with the finest boutique hotels. In this age of massive corporate hotels, true luxury is seldom seen from the service staff, for while a hotel may be grand, I have found that it is only in intimate properties where one gets to know the staff on a warmer level. This is simply not the case at The Peninsula, where by the second night many of the staff knew me by name, my preferences, and the concierge staff were absolute diamonds. They helped in many a situation, sending their men out to get things done for me at no charge at all, and arranging Rolls-Royce transfers to and from the airport at our request.
Overall, there are few hotels in the world able to deliver the product that The Peninsula does, and in light of that, even at the relatively high rates, this property is a compelling value. If you can afford it, stay nowhere else in Hong Kong."
297,Date of stay: July 2014,50,One of the truly great hotels,"We stayed on their anniversary package which apart from being amazing value was a really special experience.
We were in a harbour view suite in the old hotel wing. It has been expertly renovated and is everything a luxury hotel should be. Small touches make the difference and the peninsula delivers.

One gripe...you can't wear flip flops to breakfast (if you are MALE). Not a major problem I guess but it would be good to be told in advance rather than be turned away at the restaurant!"
298,Date of stay: July 2014,50,Just right,"This was my second stay at The Peninsula. From the airport pickup to the welcome tea, to high tea in the lobby, it was absolutely spot-on. The room updates are wonderful - super high tech. No adapters needed, just plug in.

Pastries at breakfast were amazing! I had an early flight to another China city. Restaurant wasn't open yet, but I went by and asked for a box to take. No problem - they were loaded up for me.

Only slight quibble - my wife felt like the bathroom could have been cleaner."
299,Date of stay: June 2014,20,"Big Disappointment, Won't Be Back","The Pen is the only hotel at which I have ever stayed in Hong Kong, so when we returned last month I insisted that we be booked into this hotel (our travel agent recommended against it, and suggested one or two other properties - we should have taken her suggestion).
While the Rolls Royce transportation to and from the airport was very nice, they have remodeled the rooms and while expensively done, do not fit the ambiance of the original hotel building, which is where I always liked to stay. Rather than being old world and elegant, the rooms are now sleek and modern and furnished in a manner of any upscale chain hotel. In addition, we were given, probably the worst room in the hotel, toward the back and overlooking the concrete wall of the hotel across the street. When I asked about an upgrade (our travel agent is a Virtuoso agent, which when booked through that group includes various amenities including room upgrades) we were told that nothing else was available. For almost $700 per night it was a total rip off. The attitude was snooty and somewhat condescending, and quite a departure from the way we had been treated during our past stays at this property.
The buffet breakfast was mediocre (although the room is quite lovely), the orange juice tasted like tang, when I asked for soy sauce for the dim sum that I had taken, the staff person pointed to something,saying ""it's over there"" and in fact there was no soy sauce or anything else ""over there"" and most of the wait staff was surly. I say most, because one or two of the waiters/waitresses were very accommodating, bringing us several cappuccino's and toasted bagels (something that they didn't have on the buffet tables, although they had the smoked salmon).
Unfortunately, I think the hotel, in it's 85th year, is living off it's reputation and not providing the service and amenities which it once did. On my next visit to Hong Kong, I will heed the advice of my travel agent and stay elsewhere."
300,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Fabulous Stay at The Peninsula!,"We spent three wonderful nights at The Peninsula Hotel from Monday 23 June en route to Indonesia. Having arrived on an early morning flight from UK, we were very surprised on checking in at 8.20am to find that our room was actually ready. After an 11.5 hour flight, this was very much appreciated. The receptionist, who quickly checked us in, then personally took us to our deluxe courtyard room on the third floor overlooking the fountain and showed us around.

The Room

Within 5 minutes of arriving at the room, we were served with tea. There was a 50” flat screen television on the wall in the main bedroom and another television mounted on the wall above the bath in the bathroom. Numerous complimentary toiletries by Oscar de la Rente were available together with Peninsula bedroom slippers. There was a fruit bowl that was replenished on a daily basis and a selection of local newspapers and reading material in the bedroom. Numerous other contributors have already mentioned the gadgets in the room. There were electronic buttons to open and close the roller blinds and curtains. Another button to ensure that you weren’t disturbed , and others showing the weather and temperature, housekeeping requests, room make-up, etc. Even the dressing table mirror was electronic at the push of a button and an electronic nail varnish drier was also available. Mini bar, refrigerator and a pretty Chinese tea set were also present. Outside the main bedroom, there was a dressing area leading to a separate bathroom and toilet. The bedding was good quality and we had a great night’s sleep every night. Free Wi Fi was available throughout the hotel at a good speed and we were particularly impressed that free international telephone calls could be made by pressing the VOIP button the telephone handset at no cost.

Dining

We had breakfast each morning at The Verandah restaurant. The food was of an excellent quality and the fresh fruit was particularly enjoyable. The restaurant itself was immaculate, light and airy and the staff were very welcoming, pleasant and attentive. Since the hotel is in a prime location in Tsim Sha Tsui we decided to take advantage of this and explored the other local restaurants and hotels in the area but it was always nice to come back to luxurious surroundings at the end of the day.

Activities in the Area

We enjoyed visiting the Avenue of the Stars which is a stone’s throw from the hotel and watching the spectacular Symphony of Lights show from there which stars at 8pm and is accompanied by music on Monday, Wednesday and Fridays. Harbour City, Ocean Terminal and Star House shopping centres with their designer shops are very nearby as is East Tsim Sha Tsui MTR station and the very famous Nathan Road with its hype of activity and many neon lights. Granville Road, Mody Road and Kimberley Road are also worth a visit for those discerning shoppers who become bored with the many designer shops in the area. The famous Star Ferry is an absolute must and costs about HK $5 for a single trip from Tsim Sha Tsui to Hong Kong island. A very popular area to visit on Hong Kong island is The Peak which provides an amazing view of Hong Kong island and Kowloon; it’s accessible by tram, mini bus, etc.

Conclusion

If you are anticipating staying at this wonderful world renowned hotel, do it! I first visited over 40 years ago and although the bedrooms have been updated, it has barely changed throughout that time and is still as luxurious as ever. It has always had a fabulous reputation for customer service and has very high standards. Thank you Peninsula for a great stay and experience, we hope to be able to return again one day!"
301,Date of stay: June 2014,50,A perfect grand hotel,"Simply fabulous - stunning service, gorgeous interior and first rate restaurants. We were picked up by one of their trademark Rolls Royces and zoomed into town where we were greeted by name at the main entrance. Check-in, which was accompanied by ginger tea, was carried out in our beautiful room. We ate at many of the hotel restaurants and particularly enjoyed Spring Moon. We also really enjoyed starting our evenings at the spectacular bar at Felix. The hotel is in a wonderful location and I wouldn't hesitate to return. A perfect grand hotel!"
302,Date of stay: May 2014,50,"Great service, too bad about the view","Our room was just an average room, but everything was labeled in the room, and I mean everything. The concierge communicated with you by sending a fax to your personal printer, that was in a labeled drawer. Service is the key to staying at this hotel. They seem to know you, even when we were rag tag and ratty, coming in to the hotel after being drenched by an afternoon shower. This hotel has no view. Even the bar and restaurant on the top floor ahs no view. The only view we had from the hotel was from the helicopter waiting room, and it was nice. For cheap drinks , execeptional service and a great night's sleep, the Peninsula cannot be beat."
303,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Unadultered luxury,"I sadly only stayed one night and the end of a whistlestop tour of China but was blown away by the grandeur and luxury of The Peninsula. I had wanted to stay for years after incredible feedback from clients and the experience was better than I could have imagined.

From the moment you enter the grand lobby you are swept away into the history and atmosphere of this wonderful hotel. There was not one thing I could fault - the room, the food, the service and the ambience was perfect.

Quality of this this standard comes with a price tag but if you are looking for somewhere truly amazing to stay, it doesn't come much better than this."
304,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Worth every cent!,"When booking we requested a room in the Old Wing as it just wouldn't be The Peninsula in a new room. Service from check in to check out was perfect. We loved the room which had its own entry foyer, dressing table and sitting area. There was a beautiful pot of tea and fresh fruit waiting for us.
A la carte breakfast was fantastic, everything cooked to perfection.
We decided to do the high tea and as we were guests in the hotel, we were taken straight to a table - the queue was out the front door. This too was beautiful.
The spa is a fantastic place to visit for a bit of pampering after a long day walking the city.
To finish off the experience we organised the Rolls Royce to the airport, this topped off the experience for my husband, the chauffeur also walked our bags to checkin for us.
If you want to pay the extra to stay in its hotel, you won't be disappointed."
305,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Thoughtful Elegance,"I stayed at the The Peninsula Hong Kong in November 2013 and May 2014. At the front entrance to this grand hotel, you will typically see a brigade of the Peninsula’s dark green Rolls Royce sedans. The lobby is an open three story show stopper with a gold embellished ceiling and a first floor surround consisting of high-end boutiques and a restaurant featuring afternoon tea. The staff is unfailingly friendly, the rooms are attractive, designed for the tech savvy, quiet and very comfortable, the pool and spa have a great view of Victoria Harbor and there is a broad selection of restaurants with international themes. Simply a great place to stay in Hong Kong for business or pleasure. An excellent business center for meetings."
306,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Peninsula HongKong still the best,"1980 was my Honeymoon and part of this holiday I spend a few nights in The Peninsula Hotel in HongKong.
For me today this hotel is still the best, rooms are all renovated and very beautiful, sophisticated.
The Swiss Restaurant "" Chesa""is still my Favorite Restaurant.Imagine you are in a Swiss Chalet in Switzerland but in reality you are dining in HongKong. Staff is wonderful, friendly and very helpful. The Entrance of the Peninsula is still breathtaking. For me still the best."
307,Date of stay: June 2014,50,You feel wonderful,This hotel is truly wonderful. You don't want to leave the hotel or room. Service excellent. Location very good. Prefer Kowloon over HK island. Best views are by the pool. Have a meal there at the pool so you can enjoy the view. Tea and scones in lobby are Also well worth it. We found tge concierge to be superb.
308,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Best Spa By Far,"My mum booked a spa package here for me for my birthday while I was over here visiting her . We got a package with Poolside lunch , swimming in the pool , Helicopter ride , Private spa room massage and a facial . The staff at the hotel where fantastic , I could not fault them on anything , They made out time at the hotel spa one I,ll never forget , Lunch was Devine , they even changed there menu for me as I didnt like any ontray .

I would give them 10 out of 10 , Everything was perfect and executed perfectly . Thanks for making my birthday one I,ll never forget . All ur staff are perfect in each and every single way possible ."
309,Date of stay: June 2014,40,Excessive,"I was hosted at the Peninsula in May 2014 with a group of colleagues, and we had a great time in Hong Kong. I don’t imagine that any of us would have booked this hotel ordinarily, simply because of the price.

The balance between service, friendliness and comfort makes a hotel. And frankly, for me, the service at the Peninsula was excessive to the point that it was uncomfortable. Staff didn’t nod and smile; they bowed.

Rooms were great. Everything was controlled by iPads. The TV, the lights, even the curtains were controlled by one of the four iPads placed conveniently around the room. This seemed like a great idea until I needed the bathroom in the early hours one morning, and opened the curtains, switched on the TV and adjusted the temperature to the arctic all whilst trying to turn on the bathroom light. This rather displeased my partner, who can be somewhat irritable when woken at 4.30am.

On day three, my partner found the vanity mirror when she accidentally pressed a button and it rose majestically from the dressing table, adorned by lights. Similarly, on day four I found the hidden coffee machine, and it was only after we checked out that some of our party learnt from a colleague about the secret box in the room where they hid the newspapers every morning.

Personally, I had never even considered the need to reinvent the light switch or the TV remote. Neither had my partner felt the need to hide her mirror when she wasn’t using it. And as for hiding the papers... All in all, we found the room features to be both odd and bemusing!

Breakfast was good, except it bore the formality of dinner in a normal hotel, which again was a tad uncomfortable.

On our last night we were hosted to dinner in the Felix restaurant. This was an interesting experience. The view over Victoria Harbour would have been awesome, but someone thought it a better idea to obscure the sight with venetian blinds, so we didn’t really get the full view.

Most of the group found the food to be very good, and certainly interesting. There were several small courses of food before the main course. These were fabulous, and entertained both the palate and the imagination. For main course I chose the fish, but wasn’t alone in my disappointment; it was presented in what can be best described as a pastry brick, and was cold, bland and overcooked. That said, others who chose differently were full of praise for their mains. An odd thing though; every main course was served with an amuse containing a playing card, and none of us quite worked out exactly why. The following morning, each of us woke with the same partners as we had started the evening with, so the cards continue to perplex our imaginations to the present day.

Our stay at the Peninsula was a box ticked and a good experience. But even if I won the lottery, I doubt that I will ever stay there again. There are many hotels that get the service, friendliness and comfort balance much better. And I should imagine that most of them do it with value, a component that for me the Peninsula lacked whichever way I look at it."
310,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Very few places left like it.,"I first came to the Peninsula in 1971 and it has very much the same flavor as always but updated in a very high tech way. The whole experience is special from being picked up in a Rolls Royce at the airport to High Tea in the afternoon. This time we had a suite in the old building (at our request) and it was marvelous. Won't waste time describing the amenities as you can read about them on the website. Food is good, all services are impeccable. Expensive as all get out (ie, breakfast for two will set you back ~US$120) but luxury like this must cost more. Perhaps my second favorite hotel in the world after the Hotel Cataratas in Brazil."
311,Date of stay: June 2014,50,Attitude determines altitude! And with the attitude of the Peninsula staff it will always remain the most highly rated.,"If a comparison was to be made between a hotel and a football stadium then, The Peninsula would be "" The theatre of dreams"".
Strong management and faultless staff means that their delivery of service is beyond compare!
Without doubt "" The theatre of dreams hotel ""."
312,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Best Hotel in Kowloon,"I travel to Hong Kong frequently and have tried other hotels but always come back to the Peninsula. The service is second to none and the views from the tower rooms are incredible. No trip to Hong Kong is complete without afternoon tea at the Peninsula and if you are looking for a great spot to eat lunch, try the lobby at the Peninsula. The roast beef sandwich is a great choice! If you have time for a spa treatment, the ESPA is worth the money. Every store imaginable is within walking distance and if you feel like staying indoors, the shopping arcade offers great options. Definitely THE hotel in Hong Kong."
313,Date of stay: July 2013,50,One of the world's great hotels,"This hotel consistently makes the list of the world's great hotels in various rankings, and we understand why. The facilities are wonderful and the service is outstanding.

We stayed in a Superior Suite in the original building. The suite was so nice we did not miss a harbor view. The high-ceiling room had an art deco feel but the very latest technology, including iPad-like controls for lighting, heating, room service menu, etc. The food was outstanding, especially the weekend dinner buffet in the Verandah, with a huge selection of Chinese and Western food, extremely attentive service, and a dessert bar supplemented by a made-to-order hot lemon soufflé that the wait staff suggested. There seemed to be many locals at the dinner buffet, so you should make advance reservations for weekend nights. It's pricey but worth it."
314,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Best stay in Hong Kong,"I stayed in the Deluxe Suite at the Peninsula. The room was incredible, it was hard to leave!!

The room is expansive, bathroom great, entertainment system second to none and bed the most comfortable I have slept in.

It was nice to be able to skip the lines for high tea, which is of course superb.

The shopping inside the Pen is some of the best in Hong Kong, my wife was very happy with my purchases from within the hotel!

Felix bar was nice and the Rolls Royce transfer to the airport is a nice touch. I was even walked through to check-in at the airport and escorted right to security.

Everything about the Pen is spot on and exceeds all expectations."
315,Date of stay: October 2013,50,The most luxurious hotel in the world?,"As a child, my wife had always wanted to visit Hong Kong. We decided to make Hong Kong a stop over on our next trip to Kuala Lumpur. Using Trailfinders as we always do, we decided upon the Peninsula. From being collected at the airport in one of the hotel's green rolls Royce's, our visit to the Peninsula. Truly magnificent. Having stayed in the Peninsula In Bangkok, we were expecting a wonderful stay, but this surpassed even Bangkok. A truly wonderful hotel and city."
316,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Old World Charm with Modern Features,"We have stayed at the Peninsukla at least 5 times over the years and each stay seems to bring new upgrades to the rooms.Modern features such as; electric window treatments,I-Pad use for lighting, room service etc, free long distance and wi fi make the accomadations not only high tech but also most comfortable..Now to dining..All restaurants offer various choices of both regional and continental cuisine..We found the meals in the Verandah to be convenient and delicious..Excellent service with a wide variety of choices.I must also mention the high lite of dining.Tea in the Lobby..Do not miss this ""event'.A room out of a early chinese motion picture.Elegant surroundinds and sumptuous goodies."
317,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Hong Kong Oasis,"I was expecting a lot and was not disappointed. Service was excellent; the room was perfection, from the modern iPad type controls that regulate everything in the room to the comfort of the bed. Cozy bar on second floor was a nice stop before dinner or after dinner. The gym was very nice and the pool was an oasis. This property exudes class in every respect."
318,Date of stay: May 2014,50,worth every penny,"Had heard about this property for a lifetime of travel ,so when Hong Kong finally made my itinerary there was no other choice. I was so not disappointed. Service well beyond another 5 star i've ever visited. Staff Recognized us by name everywhere .Loved the fabulous choices at sumptuous breakfast w/super attentive staff . Rooms were redone a year ago and are impressively decorated and digitalized, Free wifi in rooms. Prominent location at bayfront near museums and Star Ferry. Shopping plaza in hotel was beyond first class and uncrowded, Tea service was great also.When an error was made by transport staff, Hotel management stepped up. took complete responsibility and more than atoned for slight mistake. WELL DONE.. Be back soon."
319,Date of stay: May 2014,50,One of the top hotels to stay in HK,"This hotel is the grand dame of Hongkong. Its heritage reflects the service it gives to its customers. Staying in a suite is an experience in itself. You will know if its a good hotel by the good service the staff gives you, well disciplined and good mannered. All the items needed by the guests are gracefully served without hesitation. Its a bit old fashioned but for me, it gives you a new experience unlike the new hotels with bling decorations. This is the signature hotel of hongkong for the years to come."
320,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Stunning - but that's what you are paying for.,"We travelled with our two children and had connecting rooms. A slight glitch on the first night of the hotel putting us in two adjoining, but not interconnecting rooms was soon sorted.

Rooms themselves are outstanding - tons of though has gone into the media elements and the tablets that control the room are great fun. Extras such as the nail dryer really show the depth of service there. I particularly liked the TV in the bathroom!

We had breakfast in the lobby which was very good, though you're surrounded by hotel visitors having their breakfast here (after a while you really do view it as 'your' hotel). The buffet breakfast upstairs was excellent. Not a huge array of different foods, but enough and all great quality.

The swimming pool and associated plunge pools and sauna in the changing rooms are worth trying out. We ate by the pool one evening and a fabulous view over the city skyline make it even more special.

Goes without saying that we'd stay there again. We've had decent holidays for the money we spent there, but nothing will be quite so memorable."
321,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Legacy of Hong Kong,"As one of the most remarkable hotel in the world, Then Peninsula Hong Kong is living up to its reputation. Got a chance to stay at this incredible place during early March 2014. In term of services, it's 5 stars. The room is spacious despite the fact that it's in the Tsim sha tsui's area. The bed is very comfy that I could just lied in the bed all day. I just love everything in the room.

Also, I would recommend you to go to swimming pool, which is very luxurious. Only let down is that the smell of chlorine is very strong. Since I got a late flight, the hotel offer me to relax in its health club after check-out time.

The breakfast is very good and offer varieties of both chinese and western breakfast item. However, the chinese item (i.e. congee and dimsum) were not as good comparing to outside restaurant. But overall, the food is nice and made from high quality ingredient.

I also got a chance to have afternoon tea there. One advantage of being hotel's guest is that you don't need to queue up. The reservation can be made via reception directly. But personally, I don't think the afternoon tea at the Peninsula was that good, and it always crowded. That's the only flaw in this hotel.

If I have a chance, I will definitely go back!"
322,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Absolute luxury,"We arrived at The Peninsula gone midnight, and so we appreciated the efficient check-in of the night staff, the swift delivery of our luggage to our room, the pot of Chinese tea to welcome us, and a sumptuous room fit for the most discerning patron. Our 5 night stay was for pleasure but the amenities of the room, including a desk with stationery and a printer tucked away in a drawer, would have suited just as well for a business stopover. We had room service dinner on several occasions and it was always brought promptly, and the presentation top notch. The buffet breakfasts were excellent with an overwhelming choice. We really couldn’t fault the hotel on any aspect of our stay. We certainly intend paying another visit should we find ourselves in Hong Kong in the future."
323,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Perfection,"The hotel has completed some room/suite refurbishments and it's been done perfectly. The tradition of excellence in linens, technology,comfort and decor are all upheld but with a slightly more modern twist. Superior suite was absolutely huge and spacious with the latest in modern technology but you don't need to have a degree in engineering to be able to sort out how to turn the taps or lights on and off. All room functions are operated by an ipad and were self-explanatory and easy to use. The quality is something we enjoy about this hotel whether it's the food, courtesy of the staff, furnishings, bedding, fantastic buffet in the breakfast room, gorgeous views from Felix restaurant, the bar (which has great ambience, old school style) the quietness and sense of tranquility or the traditional decor of the foyer and public areas. Hotel transfers are excellent, we arranged ours through the hotel. We were truly grateful the hotel was able to give us an early check-in as our flight from Europe arrived at 5 a.m., Thank you The Peninsula staff. We were escorted to our room where check-in took place and on the table was a tray with coffee, croissants, fruit etc. It's a great location with an easy five minute walk to Star Ferries, Harbour City shopping mall or venturing into some of the laneways for great discounted shopping e.g., spectacles, sunglasses, sport wear, golf stuff etc. This is an iconic hotel, truly beautiful and I can't wait to return later this year."
324,Date of stay: April 2014,50,"Amazing for its comfort, tradition and technology.","Probably the best hotel in Hong Kong, in my opinion.

It is in a very central, convenient location. Right next to shops and not far from most sights. It's a few minutes walk to the ferry that will waft you across to the island of Hong Kong itself.

It's a heady mix of tradition and technology. There were three tablets in the room that let you control lights, curtains, temperature, TV, etc. The rooms are magnificient with their wood panelling. We were lucky enough to get an upgrade.

The matress was a tad hard, but that seems to be the style in this part of the world."
325,Date of stay: May 2014,50,Classy hotel,I was in this hotel this week and it is classy 5 star traditional and luxurious surroundings.Afternoon high tea was being served and the background music being played by the pianist was most relaxing.The exterior is grand complimented by a vigorous water fountain and the rolls Royce limos are an attractive feature.All told a most welcoming place with an atmosphere of grandeur associated with more traditional establishments.Highly recommend you pay this one a visit you will not be disappointed.
326,Date of stay: April 2014,50,First class,"well,we did fly economy class,but we booked Rolls to pick us up at the airport.The lady from hotel met us as soon as we left the plane and took accompanied us tall teh way to the exit,wouldn't allowed us to touch our suitcases.Then we were ""take over"" by the other representative from the hotel .The Rolls was parked there with smiling uniformed driver.It was just fantastic,we felt soo VIP.The ride to the hotel was the real expiriance!!Worth every dollar(round trip about $450 AUS)
The hotel was very stilish,I loved the bed and bedding,pillows are amazing!!
Of course afternoon tea is event,it is a great feeling to be taken by one of the staff straight to your table while there is a long queue of ""ordenery"" people staring at you.
Hotel made mistake with our spa booking so to make it up we were given special package including private spa room overlooking Victoria Harbour-compliments of the hotel,now how good service is that!!"
327,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Classic and luxurious,i love every minute and everything about this hotel. I stayed here in August for 2 nights. The harbour view room is breath-taking. It is spacious and spotless. The bed and the pillows are very comfy. The breakfast buffet was awesome. The high tea in the lobby is a must.
328,Date of stay: April 2014,50,A Memorable Evening,"We recently entertained friends [25] for cocktails at the Peninsula to celebrate a birthday.We had reserved the Chinese Clipper room on the 30th floor of the hotel.Arrangements were made with Jobee of the Peninsula by email.The process of organising the event was made easy by the courteous and professional approach of Jobee.
Our guests have complimented the unique nature of the venue,its sense of intimacy,comfort,views and unusual aviation memorabilia.They have also commented on the wonderful service of the Peninsula staff,the ratio of staff to guest and small touches such as escorting guests from the lift to the function room and rose petals placed around flower arrangements.The hor d'oeuvres were excellent and flow of food and beverages very good.
We were thrilled with all aspects of this unique venue and the fact that our guests were equally pleased made it a memorable evening."
329,Date of stay: May 2014,50,What is not to love,"Amongst the madness that is street life in Hong Kong stands this bastion of refinement and good taste.

I have always wanted to stay here and recently indulged in three glorious days at The Peninsula.

It is so close to everything that it is a perfect location. Close to shopping in Kowloon and a quick walk to the Ferry which gives you access to Hong Kong Island.

We booked through the hotel and so got an automatic upgrade and some beautiful house chocolates.

The room wasn't the most beautiful I have stayed in or the most imaginative decor but it was tasteful and lovely. The corridors would rank up there in my top 2 along with the Bellagio in Las Vegas. Loved the pop up Vanity mirror although it could do with more light, labels on everything made looking for safes, hair dryers etc obsolete. Free movies was a nice indulgence.

We didn't find the bed the most comfortable it needed some more padding.

Afternoon Tea is just a must do indulgence. Breakfast was very good but not sensational and was certainly pricey.

Service at the hotel is excellent, you really can't fault anyone.

So all in all - the reviews are all true. This is an exceptional hotel and well worth treating yourself.

So all the"
330,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Fabulous!,"We stayed at The Peninsula at the end of our Cruise and it was as wonderful as we remembered. This was our third time there and the service was as great as always. Our room was beautiful and very high tech. There was an IPad on each side of the bed with controls for lights, TV etc. The amenities were numerous and the room was spotlessly clean. We also enjoyed their luxurious spa. That shouldn't be missed. If we return to Hong Kong we will stay there once again."
331,Date of stay: May 2014,50,#1 For Many Good Reasons,"I am a repeat guest of the Peninsula Hong Kong. A classic, luxurious hotel which frequently sits atop world-wide hotel rankings. Across two decades of visits to the Pen, I can say that it continues to delight in every category. Rooms, location, service, food, and overall scene are consistently world-class across every category, across time.

Yes, it is expensive, but for the excellence received, I consider it very good value. It is also a wonderful experience to just soak in such outstanding service, and to challenge oneself in whether you too are capable of delivering such service to one's own clients or customers.

A life well-lived includes a visit to the Peninsula Hong Kong."
332,Date of stay: March 2014,50,The perfect Hong Kong hotel,"This is the perfect Hong Kong hotel though it's on the Kowloon side. I've stayed here for thirty years. I've also stay at the mandarin and the four seasons. But I keep coming back to the Peninsula. In my opinion, it's still the best. The service is professional and outstanding. The rooms are lovely and very peaceful ( once you learn how to use the new hi tech pad where you can open the drapes, call room service (and order dinner or a snack) and housekeeping, order a movie to be shown on your flat screen tv, turn the lights on and off and lock the doors. Once this is simple, everything comes together. The rooms have everything one needs, comfortable couches, chairs and a good mattress. Lovely green marble bathroom with double vanities, a separate shower and tub, a small (extra) tv and soft, very large bath towels. The view of the harbor could be lovely if it were not for the smog and fog. Our room had a large picture window with a nu obstructive view. It was a shame that the smog was so think. Breakfast in the veranda is a treat. You can have the typical dim sum or just about any and everything that can be ordered at breakfast time. The Spring Moon a Restaurant is excellent for Cantonese cuisine as is their fine Gaddis for a continental menu. Tea in the lobby is perfect with violins playing in the background buy a reservation is necessary. And the location is perfect. Have them pick you up in a vintage rolls or a bently to begin your stay."
333,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Luxury Favourite,"The Peninsula lived up to its billing as a firm family favourite.

This hotel has over the past 25 years been the destination of choice in the Far East for us, in fact, a destination in itself. The whole experience fits together perfectly.

Our check in was effortless, and being at 8.30am we were offered a temporary room across the corridor from the room that had been allocated to us.

As a group of 9, we had requested, and were allocated with 3 adjacent rooms, which was perfect. Our room was equipped, as requested, with a child's bed, and the other children in our family group were also suitably accommodated.

Service was attentive and friendly at all times, including several uses of the hotel's extensive room service menu. We only needed to request ice to keep bottles chilled once, and thereafter ice was provided to us on a daily basis.

Catering was excellent at all times. Largely we ordered room service, to suit our young families. The room service menu is suitably extensive and the quality is excellent.

We also dined at the Verandah (brunch), Chesa, Spring Moon and at the poolside. All were faultless in my view.

We did visit Felix one evening. It was certainly impressive for a drink, but we might have appreciated the view to have not been obscured by blinds.

The pool facilities were a true highlight for us. The pool is warm enough to enjoy without being too warm, and the view over the harbour is spectacular. We used these facilties at least once per day.

I also was able to have a massage, which again was excellent. The spa level has a separate steam room and sauna to the facilities available to all guests, the sauna with a view over the harbour, which is simply incredible and worthy of comment.

Concierge services were well informed for all of our needs.

The only negative points I would note would be:
(1) that the bedside tablets are quite unnecessary and can inadvertently be activated during the night. We took to taking the tablets off their cradles overnight and leaving them with the desk tablet.
(2) the media / bar cabinet closing in the rooms could be 'softer'
(3) the marble floors around the pool are incredibly slippery and are simply dangerous. It is all well and good for attendants to assist with the provision of marble safe slippers, but it would be better for the surfaces themselves not to be so treacherous

That said, overall we had the most amazing visit to Hong Kong, enhanced most certainly by the Peninsula experience, thanks to the wonderful facilities and staff.

In my view, if I'm fortunate enough to be able to stay at the Peninsula, I would choose to do so every time.

Thank you Peninsula Team for another wonderful stay."
334,Date of stay: May 2014,40,Lacking the personal and attentive service when compared to my last stay.,"As a regular visitor to Hong Kong, until recently I’d always opted for the InterContinental Hong Kong. With the Peninsula’s refurbishment complete, I stayed last year and was very impressed. So looked forward to my return visit.

In all a pleasant stay, however lacking the same level of attentive and personal service as last time. Based on this stay it won’t be my default hotel of choice next time I’m in Hong Kong. More details should you wish….

The Arrival:-
Having booked the hotel Rolls Royce Phantom ($1,600 HKD as of May-14) a hotel representative meets you at the air bridge, and you are escorted through immigration and customs to the vehicle. The journey to the hotel took ~30 minutes. Disappointingly, unlike last time, there was no meet-and-greet at the hotel with in-room check-in. Poor for a premium hotel when booking their transportation. Luggage took over half an hour to be delivered to the room - also poor.

The Guest Room:-
The Grand Deluxe Harbour View room was well appointed. Decor is contemporary, and the integrated tablet control system allows you to control most electronic devices in the room from one device. Unfortunately as the window doesn’t extend the full height and width of the room, the view from most of the room is directly across from the hotel (the convention centre) with the more impressive taller buildings of the Hong Kong island skyline being off to the far right.

The Bars:-
'Salon Ning' bar & club has a 1930's Shanghai theme; service was average. 'The Bar' offers a selection of main stream whisk(e)y, and other drinks, with classic décor – service was fine. Neither are open until late afternoon.

Breakfast:-
You can choose between a la carte (in the lobby) or buffet (in the Veranda). The buffet provided a broad selection to choose from. Service on the first day was attentive, however on the second not.

The Spa:-
Recommended - a good selection of treatments, very relaxing and well appointed."
335,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Luxury Reloaded,"I have to say the Peninsula is an extremely unique hotel, steeped in history, but at the cutting edge of luxury and technology. When my wife and I decided to visit Hong Kong, The Peninsula was the only hotel I considered, despite being an avid Four Seasons patron.

Upon arrival the hotel is immediately impressive, with it's raft of Rolls Royce Phantoms for all to see, although at times the outside can get quite full of cars, which can detract a little from the pomp and circumstance that this hotel emanates.

The lobby is a sight to behold, with it's impressive décor, imposing staircase, galleried orchestra area and plethora of designer shops as far as the eye can see. After being checked in we were escorted to our room, where a huge expanse of floor to ceiling glass perfectly framed the spectacular Hong Kong harbour by night. I have to say at that point I kind of switched off and didn't hear a word the desk clerk had to say. This is where I begin to run out of superlatives, sufficed to say the view is out of this world, and over the five days it wasn't one we tired of.

Our Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room was nicely spacious, with every technological advancement you could possibly want, 3 tablet computers (1 on each nightstand and 1 on the writing desk) are your central hub for both room control and information. There is also 50” 3D LED TV with a hidden subwoofer, 3D BluRay player, a charging hub for almost every mobile phone or tablet you could possibly think of, and even a nail dryer, these are just some of the vast array of gadgets at hand. Every control and information point is an LCD touchscreen. I have to say as an IT consultant and all round gadget fiend, I was left gob smacked, from a technology standpoint it makes the Burj Al Arab look like it's something out of the dark ages! The hotel exudes quality and style, and an opulence which is quite unique.

Sadly the only restaurant we frequented was The Verandah for breakfast, the buffet was simply outstanding, with everything you could wish for, irrespective of which continent you decided to dine at. My one gripe was that on our first morning at breakfast we were greeted by some kind of waitress who was a) a little surly, and b) looked us up and down, not acceptable as far as I am concerned, you make everyone feel welcome, after all, it's the guests home whilst they're staying there. My wife and I decided to order room service rather than visit the hotel restaurants, after a hard days sightseeing there's nothing more relaxing than a long hot bath, and eating dinner in front of the TV, and it was very impressive to say the least, we eat a varied array of cuisines, and they were all of an exception standard.

The Spa is most impressive, capitalising on it's high vantage points, and great views, if I had to make one criticism I would say the changing rooms for the pool were down some very narrow stairs, which don't make it the most convenient to get to and from, but not a big deal.

So often reality is a pale comparison to your imagination, well, this is one of those rare cases where the reality is even better, this is a prestigious hotel, and rightly so, it is simply stunning, and will be our choice again the next time we visit Hong Kong."
336,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Magnificent,"The Peninsula has long been on our list of 'must dos' and I was a little concerned that it wouldn't live up to expectations. But our stay was fantastic.

We had booked a Delux harbour view room - which was bigger than I was expecting and very nicely decorated. The only downside was that it was a smoking room and when we called to ask to move to a non-smoking room we were incredibly surprised to be shown to a corner suite overlooking the harbour. This room was absolutely spectacular and consisted of dining room, living room, bedroom, dressing room and enormous bathroom overlooking Kowloon. For an old hotel, I was surprised to see how high-tech it was - you can control the curtains, lights, heating and and TVs from an ipad. The TVs had a very wide range of channels and free movies.

We also booked a couples spa package - which included a fantastic bath tub overlooking the harbour - -and the massage was one of the best I've ever had.

The staff were friendly, helpful and professional and overall our experience was second to none."
337,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Serious Luxury,"The Peninsula is a historic building on the Kowloon side of HK. It stands for elegance and old money glamour. A seriously seductive place to stay, get married, or for an overpriced high tea. Beautiful."
338,Date of stay: April 2014,40,Luxury and Tradition,"The hotel is over 85 years old and does a very good job combining the modern with the traditional. Everything here was spotless, high tech, and luxurious; but, we found the service somewhat lacking when it came to face to face communication. All our email communications prior to arrival, including those requesting the Rolls Royce pick up service and short notice lunch reservation at a popular restaurant, were dealt with promptly and with a great attitude. However, when we arrived at the hotel after a long flight, we felt we could have been greeted in a warmer, friendlier manner. The check in process was a bit slow and the staff seemed less than eager to help us along. This was not true of the staff at check out though. On the plus side, the wifi in the Rolls Royce was a nice touch and much appreciated. We were having a nice time in the car until our driver burped and filled the car with a pungent garlicky smell. Although you can probably blame this one on cultural differences, it was still an unpleasant experience for us.

We had breakfast in the Verandah, which we preferred over the lobby restaurant. The breakfast spread was not as extensive as other luxury hotels we've been to, but it served the purpose just fine.

We did ask for the shopping arcade discount vouchers upon check in, and were presented with an expired voucher for the chocolate shop. We didn't bother to go back and ask for another one, even though we purchased some delicious (and expensive!) chocolates. The rest of the shopping arcade was also really nice, offering numerous clothing and jewelry luxury brands.

The pool area in the tower section of the hotel was gorgeous, offering a great view of the harbor. We were here 18 years ago and don't remember the street view of the harbor being obstructed by the building across the street back then. It is now! We could see the harbor clearly though from the pool on the 8th floor. The pool was really nice, the kind of pool you'd want to swim in even if you're not particularly into swimming in hotel pools.

If you'd like to experience the best the city has to offer, then the Peninsula is it. The locals are very proud of the hotel. And, the VIPs prefer to stay here, although they like to be picked up from the airport and transported to the hotel by helicopter. Come here if you can afford it. It's practically a tourist destination and must see when in Hong Kong."
339,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Just top!,"Stay in a room in the front. We got a upgrade to a fanatic suite at 82 m2. Free IP telefon and a complementy dinner. The pick up service with one of the hotells fifteen Rolls-Royce Phantoms was like a royal welcome. The best hotel we evner have visit!,"
340,Date of stay: April 2014,50,A Touch of Class,"I have been to Hong Kong more than 50 times but mainly for business so never stayed at The Peninsula. I had been to Felix for dinner but staying there is a completely different experience.

From check in to check out, it was magnificent. I'm really sorry I never got the name of the lady who checked us in because she was like something from of a film set. Calm, friendly, informative and very professional. The sort of person that made you smile, feel valued and relaxed.

We had Harbour View Rooms and I think it is the best room I have ever had. The technology (for a change) worked flawlessly and I could sit all day and look at the boats in the harbour and the magnificent skyline of the island. The rooms themselves are bright but with deep dark wood and beautifully appointed.

The service throughout was probably the highest standard I have experienced in 30 years of travelling. Given its reputation I was slightly worried that it would not live up to my expectations. I shouldn't have worried. It was magnificent.

We ate at Felix on the Saturday night. Definitely worth doing and you must get a window seat. Great food and wine list.

I do have two small grips though! I know the afternoon tea is an institution in itself but this makes the entrance and the lobby very crowded and somehow disorganised. Once you get past that everything changes. The other is that in Felix, both the bar and restaurant, the windows have blinds. Why? One of the best views in the world don't need blinds! Management - please address this!

That being said I offer my congratulations to the management and team. Keep up the excellent work and I look forward to visiting again."
341,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Top top top,Top of the top. It exceeded all our expactations. Amazing service. Incredible rooms with outstanding views. All the top technology you can dream in a hotel room and even more. We didn't want to leave. Hard to go somewhere else than Pennisulas in Asia
342,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Just Sheer Class!!!!,"I always love it when I go to Hong Kong, that means staying at the Peninsula and it has never ever disappointed us.

The new rooms are sensational. Using an IPad to control your rooms lighting, temperature etc is just so easy. The VOIP phone allows you to phone home for free, a very handy saving on ones mobile account.

The food and service were as usual superb. We enjoyed a Spa on the morning we were to rejoin the Queen Mary 2 and took a bit longer than planned. Not a problem for the hotel, but then again this hotel never seems to have problems only very satisfied guests.

Until the next time, we can't wait."
343,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Sets the benchmark,"If this isn't the best hotel in the world, I'd like to see what is! From the moment you enter it's opulent lobby you can tell this is going to be something oh so special - and it does not disappoint. From the impeccable service to the fine dining, it's a class above all others. And it's the little things that it does so well, as if they should be taken for granted. If you ever travel to Hong Kong, you must experience at least one night here - you will certainly not regret it, and will probably remember it for a long time!"
344,Date of stay: April 2014,50,The best of the best!,"Although I have not been everywhere, I have traveled a lot and stayed at some amazing hotels. I must say that The Peninsula in Hong Kong is by far the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The rooms are state of the art. Ours had three Ipads to control everything in the room. The bathroom was amazing. Large soaking tub, mirrors everywhere, wonderful shower, and top of the line bath products. The Rolls Royce ride to the airport was awesome. Splurge if you can!"
345,Date of stay: April 2014,50,"Stylish, High Tech, and almost perfect service","Very tradicional architecture, pretty hotel and good location. Very high tech, you control virtually everything from the ipads spread throughout the room (from TV to lights, air conditioner, radio, movies on demand, curtains and menu for room service). Service is impeccable. Obviously, this comes to a price. All restaurants have dressing code. Gym is state of art. Best room service ever - food comes hot and as if you went to a restaurant."
346,Date of stay: April 2014,40,High tech and history combined,"Stayed 2 nights for a wedding in April 2014. Having stayed previously at the Four Seasons in Hong Kong, the Peninsula offered comparably fewer facilities, most notably the spa/pool. Our deluxe room was lovely and we appreciated the early check-in and fruit platter. It was wonderfully convenient to stumble upstairs after the wedding, but we could have had a better value experience next door at either the YMCA or the Sheraton. That said, service was almost too polite - the cleaner switched off the vacuum as we passed in the corridor, lest our delicate ears be disturbed :p"
347,Date of stay: April 2014,40,A dip in service at one of the great hotels,"I love the Peninsula and have been staying here for years. Renovations have been carefully executed, the hotel and it's rooms are gorgeous, and there is much to love. But the training of the staff has suffered a bit, everyone seems a bit confused, I had to ask for many things twice, and while everyone was pleasant and wanted to be helpful, the exceptional service I've always associated with the hotel wasn't delivered. The Japanese restaurant was especially disappointing, both the service and the food. The hotel is still great, but definitely not operating on all thrusters."
348,Date of stay: February 2014,50,The Only Place to Stay in Hong Kong,"Arrived Feb. 27th for a 7 night stay at this outstanding hotel. Our suite was large, well appointed with a large bathroom and housekeeping maintained it beautifully. The staff went out of their way to make sure that our stay was special. Each morning the buffet breakfast was large and the variety was plentiful. We are still talking about the best Peking duck we ever had in the Spring Moon dining room. For a wonderful view of the harbor, Felix was outstanding for dinner and the view.
But it was the concierge service that will always be remembered as the best we ever experienced, and specifically, do to Brian at the Concierge Desk that we had great private tours, he sent us to the best local Asian restaurants and made sure that our first stay in Hong Kong would be a memorable one. Brain made our stay special. He is a true professional and an asset to the Peninsula brand."
349,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Fantastic hotel,"Only one night here, wish we could have had longer.Perfect stay from start to finish.The large newly decorated room had every comfort, with lights, curtains, etc controlled from several tablets around the room. Lovely bathroom with excellent amenities. The room was on a high floor so wonderful views of the harbour and the light show.Afternoon tea and breakfast were both delightful, beautifully presented.
A memorable stay."
350,Date of stay: April 2014,50,Flawless,"I had a four night stay here in April 2014 (room 2212). The room itself was superb, my opinion not merely a function of the fine view over the harbour. All the little things that are so often a small irritation in hotel rooms had been thought of. There were plenty of electricity sockets, and no need to crawl around on the floor either as both the room desk and the bedside tables had sockets and even phone chargers. There was a Nespresso coffee machine, a hairdryer and even a nail dryer for those with such a need.

The shower was excellent, with strong water pressure, a well-placed shelf and even a seat. Oscar de la Renta shampoos were provided. All the functions of the room, such as the curtains and the ""do not disturb"", were controlled from a pad by the bed. Even the drawers were labelled so it was easy to find the laundry bag etc. There was a chaise longue with a convenient shelf, ideal for reading. The bed was comfortable and had excellent flexible, directed bedside lights, much better than the often inadequate fixed lamps that so many hotels provide. A little cabinet is provided by the door for getting shoes shined and returned without needing staff to disturb the guests.

The staff were excellent in the hotel, helpful and plentiful. The gym was good and there was an attractive swimming pool and sun deck. Breakfast was a buffet though you could have omelettes etc made to order. All in all this was a really well thought out experience, the room exceptionally well designed and the staff carefully trained. I travel a lot and it is rare to encounter a hotel experience this flawless. I have stayed here in the past and will happily do so in the future."
351,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Well worth the money!,This was class at its best from the suite to the spa to the pool to high tea to restaurant Felix at the top. Can't wait to go back for a few days during my next trip. We didn't leave the hotel the entire 24 hour stay and it was as romantic as cab be for celebrating my 40th wedding anniversary.
352,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Ultimate luxury and pampering in vibrant Hong Kong,"After being whisked through the airport we arrived in style in a Rolls Royce. The room was well-appointed with a great view of the Hong Kong skyline. Breafast is a sumptuous affair, the Felix bar a must visit. The hotel is very central with easy access to ferrys and trains. Service was friendly and efficient. The Peninsula met every expectation!"
353,Date of stay: March 2014,40,Not quite the grand dame of class,"Having had wonderful experiences at The Peninsula Beijing and The Peninsula New York, expectations were high when we checked in for our 3-night stay at The Peninsula Hong Kong. We left feeling a little underwhelmed, not so much because the hotel was poor but because it was quite outshone by its other sisters.

The standard rooms were not available during our stay so we had paid for a Deluxe room and were pleasantly surprised to get an upgrade to a room with a better view. The room was spacious and nicely appointed and the bed was comfortable. Housekeeping provided a comfortable cot for our toddler with toys and fresh new bedding, which was a nice touch. There was always ice when you needed it and a large flask/kettle was brought in at our request. We always like it when the marble flooring of the bathroom doesn't feel ice cold to the touch in the early morning and this was a feature of the bathroom, which was enormous and had two separate wash sinks which allowed us to wash up in double the time. If I had a quibble about the layout of the room, it would be that the hairdryer can only be used outside the bathroom - this is not very convenient when you have a sleeping baby whom you're trying not to awake before the start of the day!

So why were we left feeling less than totally satisfied? We both felt that the service lacked a personal touch that had made the Beijing and NY hotels such a standout. It was good but trended towards being coolly professional and efficient rather than the warm homely hospitality we had come to expect from the Peninsula group. The locals seem to sense it too. We took quite a few cabs due to immobility issues (serious case of diaper bag malfunctioning) and more than one cab driver asked us why we had chosen to stay at The Peninsula instead of a hotel like the Four Seasons. In their view, the hotel is a fading gem that has lost its former lustre. It was our first time here so we could not compare our stay with a previous visit. However, we did have a meal on our second day at Lung King Heen at the Four Seasons and were impressed with the hotel service outside the restaurant, so we will probably be staying there the next time we are in Hong Kong. It w"
354,Date of stay: April 2013,50,High noon tea at the Peninsula,"Enjoy the high noon tea at the peninsula, very nice and great chice of tea, excellent service, good atmosphere with live music, see also the Felix restaurant and bar on the top floor. The Felix is designed by Philippe Starck - really nice, and you have a great view on the city, even from the toilets and of course from the bar."
355,Date of stay: September 2013,50,The Best of the Best,"Wow! From the moment you walk in the door, if not prior (the hotel offers chauffeured Rolls Royce service from the airport (at a price !)), you feel like you've ""arrived."" This magnificent city hotel is one of the highest rated in Asia, for good reason - it's perfect. Great location, adjacent to Nathan Road & the ferry. The rooms are beautiful and every detail is special. They've thought about everything here & it comes through & through! Be sure to also visit the dim sum restaurant across the bay at the Mandarin Oriental for s meal you won't forget!
Enjoy!"
356,Date of stay: February 2014,50,A luxurious stay,"Finally took the plunge and stayed a weekend at The Peninsula....and I'm so glad we did! The hotel more than lives up to it's reputation and the whole experience was great. The room was beautiful with a very modern design and the high tech controls were super convenient. We booked in at the spa as well which is definitely recommended - the massages were top notch, not to mention the great view of the harbour. The hotel really is an icon and we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend getaway."
357,Date of stay: March 2014,50,A luxurious treat.,"We ended our Hong Kong stay by treating us to a couple of nights in a Peninsula Hotel suite with harbour view. The newly refurbished rooms are a high-tech wonder with digital flat panels controlling all room service and audiovisual functions. A complimentary espresso machine, wine cooler, and nail dryer are among the less common accessories to be found.The ambiance of the foyer with live classical music wafting down from the balconey is a hallmark of the Peninsula.
The breakfast buffet is excellent. One does however have to pay a high price for such luxury."
358,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Worthy of it's reputation,"The Peninsula has been one of the great Hong Kong hotels since it opened in 1928. Famous for it's high standards and fleet of dark green Rolls Royces we wondered whether it still deserved it's reputation. It has undergone a major refurbishment since we last visited (but did not stay) at the hotel and it combines traditional style in the public spaces with up to the minute modern rooms with lights, curtains, temperature, TV all controlled from an iPad-like tablet. Messages are faxed to the room and there is free wifi and international telephone calls. Breakfast were sumptuous. Swimming pool and Spa were also top notch. The queue of people not staying at the hotel for afternoon tea is mildly irritating but not enough to detract from a great and memorable stay."
359,Date of stay: March 2014,50,"The right ingredients of high tech, luxury furnishing, elegant ambience which create comfort and warm feeling like none others!","We stayed at the deluxe suite harbour view suite which has the right combination of everything that you need for a home away from home....

The attention to details in all part of the suite deserve a high applause.
The Peninsula seems to have a goal to fulfil every little things that a guest might need by preparing all the details you can ever think of during your stay one step ahead of you. Everything that you need is all there before you even look for it or before you think you need it: the pen located next to laundry bag, the nail dryer machine for your last minute nail polish, the welcome chinese tea and the tea set to give you a taste of HongKong's tradition, the complimentary mini cooper with a chauffeur for suite's guests to take you around the city.

Privacy is another thing that this hotel seems wants to offer to their guests by providing a valet box in each room which minimise disturbance from the door bell to the availability of portable note books for ordering or sourcing information during your stay: tv channel, in-room dining to a simple extra towels etc.

I also adore the complimentary amenities from Oscar de la renta, if I am not mistaken, The Peninsula's chain is the only one in the world that collaborate with Oscar de la renta for their amenities, which I can say is a good move as it enhances the image and increase the level of guest's satisfaction knowing that excellent products are provided during the stay.

I went to inspect the standard room as well during my stay, and yes as expected all rooms have all the same products and services as the suite and the only difference is the room size which is obviously will be smaller than a suite.

Location wise is a big plus too. The shopping arcade of big brands are within the building from LV, Goyard, Hermes, Chanel, etc which is so convenient. For cheaper options, you can just literarily take a step out of the hotel's side entrances and you'll find jordan street and nathan stree that full of shops, supermarket, local eateries, mtr station of east tsim sha tsui. For tourist's attraction, across the hotel is the avenue of the stars and if you want to take the ferry to macau, the terminal is just 5 minutes walk.

Another plus point is the level of professionalism and friendliness of the staff at The Peninsula which is the result of long service duration of each staff that creates such a high sense of belonging thus gives their very best in assisting guests ( many of the staff that assisted us while our stay have been part of the Peninsula for years... We were even told one staff has been working there for the past 57 years... ( Talking about loyalty and love your work)

If you are willing to spend and you are not on a budget, this is a perfect place to stay in HK for a tourist ( first comers or regular travellers), for business travellers as the location is so accessible and for honeymooners as the building is classic, elegant and modern at the same time.
Don't forget to book their RollsRoyce limo service if you have the extra money to spend... It is another wow experience from The Peninsula."
360,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Just a confirmation...,"For my stay in Hong Kong I chose The Peninsula because I was there another couple of times and, moreover I was coming from The Peninsula in Tokyo and I was interested to compare the two hotels..
The first surprise: the unexpected pick up at the airport with a luxurious trip from the airport to the Hotel with a spectacular green rolls-royce ( not the one in the James Bond film ""Gldfinger"" but its nephew ...)
Hong Kong is still spectacular and the Hotel is a superb ""old LAdy"" in this futuristic city.
Service is spectacular and the rooms are so wide and clean.
Judgement: Strongly suggested"
361,Date of stay: February 2014,30,They have lost the plot.,"The Grand Old Lady has been renovated to the highest level but she has lost her charm as a great place to stay. She is more Disneyland than Luxury Hotel now.

Our delivery by Rolls Royce from the airport should have felt special. On arrival we were let out of the car and pointed to the entrance. From that moment on it went all wrong. Standing in the middle of a huge lobby/lounge area we had no idea where to go. We found check in, after passing a desk that turned out to be the Concierge but had no notice to that effect.

Our room was superb in every way. Beautifully renovated and state-of-the-art controls via electronic tablets. The bathroom was equally excellent. However we were woken up two nights in a row with lights coming on and strange things happening. Eventually they determined it was a problem with the tablet so high tech can cause problems as well as bring joy!

The hotel is famous for its afternoon tea, which is held in the beautiful and grand lobby. People start lining up at just after 1 p.m. - tea starts at 2 p.m. In order to get to the elevator to our room we had to file past lines of people, the line went towards the outside door on a Saturday. This gives the hotel a ""theme"" atmosphere and many people now come in as tourists to gawk at the decor.

On arrival we tried to get a massage in the Spa for the next few days. Nothing was available at a decent hour. Needless to say, we checked out on the Sunday and moved to the wonderful Mandarin Oriental Hotel on Hong Kong island. We managed to get a massage at the Spa in no time. A much better experience and a true five star. The Peninsula is a four star in a five star's clothing."
362,Date of stay: March 2014,50,Far beyond my expectations,"Staying at The Peninsula in Hong Kong was a special treat to myself and a wonderful experience I will never forget. Each person from the Hotel goes out of their way to quietly make sure you have The Best Stay. Pay the Extra for the Experience - it is not just a room.
I Recommend a pool swim with breathtaking views and a visit to the amazing Spa. I also had a wonderful dinner at their restaurant, Felix, specifically ordered The Felix Experience Menu - spectacular!
You only live once."
363,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Boutique atmosphere in a big hotel,"We have stayed 4 nights during middle of January, it was excellent experience. Service is top from all aspects and everything was just great. The rooms are well occupied, very high tech but you still feel very comfort, beds are very comfortable and it is great to be back to the hotel after long day in HK area. Try the SPA and get the view from the spa and also from the bar at the top floor."
364,Date of stay: March 2014,40,Excellent,"We had stayed in HK at the start of a 4 week trip and on on our way back were recommended to stay at the Peninsula even if it was for one night. We had their Rolls Royce pick us up. Great experience. The room is lovely. Opulent but modern at the same time. Staff are very helpful. Breakfast and afternoon tea excellent. No longer one of the best positions due to all the building work but very convenient. On our travels it was the best hotel, the best bed and the best breakfast. Mind you I couldn't stay there too long as it is a bit too formal for me."
365,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Simply the best,"My husband and I spent 3 nights here at the end of our honeymoon before returning to Chicago. If you aren't happy at the Peninsula, you won't be happy anywhere. It's 5 star all the way.

The location is perfect for jumping on the ferry to Hong Kong island and nothing seemed too far away if you're willing to take the MTR.

The concierge helped us arrange a couple of dinners and made making reservations seamless and the help they offered us with directions and so forth was very helpful as well.

This place is luxury at it's best."
366,Date of stay: October 2013,50,FANTASTIC!,"I love The Peninsula.. Luxury at its finest. The service was impeccable, the food outstanding, the location perfect and Fexix...not to miss! Do yourself a favor and stay at this fantastic property, you will not be disappointed."
367,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Incredible... would do anything to go back!,"I loved my stay here... the rooms have been beautifully refurbished and are very modern and contemporary in style. Would reccomend the grand luxury rooms so that you have amazing views of Hong Kong Island. The service and food was top notch. There is a lovely spa, gym and swimming pool - great place to relax after a busy day sightseeing. It is in a great location - walking distance from Star Ferry terminal, main shopping streets. I personally think it is best to stay on Kowloon side so that you have the iconic HKG island views.

Cannot wait to return one day."
368,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Most amazing hotel,"This is the most amazing hotel i've ever stayed in in my life. From the service to the food to the rooms - i absolutely loved it. You have to go to Felix the restaurant in the peninsula, the view is BEAUTIFUL and the vibe is just amazing. The food for breakfast is exquisite. I loved that the hotel had shopping in it as I could go there on a raint day if I didn't want to leave the hotel. Also the rooms had an outstanding view. The experience was just spectacular."
369,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Fabulous hotel. Pit about Felix Bar,Faultless. Luxury service and worth the price tag. Amazingly good swimming pool. You might expect a good view of Hong Kong Harbour from the top floor bar. Alas this world famous sight is obscured by a Venetian Blind that does not retract. The bar itself looks like the set from a 1970's episode of Star Trek. Pity.
370,Date of stay: February 2014,50,Excellent,"I stayed in this hotel for the anniversary with my family.
In the room, the facility is perfect. The printer is set in the room and
I could work. I was wondering whether we should stay as
some people wrote the complain about this hotel in this site.
However, the staff's service is good. This hotel has long histry.
We could spend the wonderful time in the clasical mood."
371,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Outstanding,"I stayed here in January 2014 and the entire stay was outstanding. The staff were simply amazing, even the little things like stopping and allowing you to pass them when you walk down the hallway, and always greeting every guest go a long way in leaving a lasting impression of professionalism and courtesy. The rooms were world class, have you ever stayed in a hotel where the rooms are controlled entirely from a touch screen device? Have you been in a bathtub with a TV? It just got better and better. The rooms even had a cupboard to place your shoes, where the concierge would remove them from the outside of the room, buff them and return them almost immediately. Truly an excellent service as I was staying there for a wedding. The pool and spa areas were luxurious."
372,Date of stay: February 2014,30,"Average service, or even poorer?","Very good location and hotel facilities, spacious room, touch screen control of lights, electric appliance in the room, very beautiful view from the swimming pool.....

However, I am disappointed at the hotel service which claims to be the strength of the hotel:

1) Check-in: When I checked in around 13:30, I was told the room was not ready until around 14:30 to 15:00. Well, I can understand the big season during the Chinese New Year so I took the lunch in the lobby. I asked twice after 14:30, the receptionists were nice but I had to wait until sometime after 15:00. The second time the receptionist told me to get a seat or have a drink in the lobby and I would be informed when the room was ready. I told her I was taking lunch in the lobby. The truth is the lobby was full of people waiting, either queue for the famous afternoon tea or standing for the room to be ready - it is like a train station my wife said. I did not know how can I get seated if I would not take the lunch in the lobby right after I get in the hotel. I waited until 15:20 when I saw the large group of people disappeared - I assume the rooms were ready - and asked the receptionist the 3rd time. Now the room was ready. I don't need the lip service of the receptionist: first, no seats were available in such period of time - I don't think she will help me to find one; second, nobody informed me about the room availability until I asked again. Why overpromise?

2) Lunch experience in the lobby: the waiters were busy, or rushed to do lots of things. I ordered the set lunch with 3 courses. When the main course came, the waiter just took away my salad (I haven't finished yet) without asking me whether I finished.

3) Now came the most disappointed one: I left my passport and keys in the safe when I checked out at around 12:20. I deposited my luggage with the hotel and took the afternoon tea starting 15:00. I left the hotel for airport at 17:00. I did not realize my passport was not with me until I started check-in in the airport. I called the hotel and was immediately confirmed they had my passport and keys kept in the room service (or another division?). I asked for the delivery of the passport and keys to the airport which the hotel did in 40 minutes.

I really appreciate the quick delivery service which made me catch the flight. I just don't understand why the hotel didn't find ways to catch me before I called them: I provided the telephone number when I check-in, I deposited my luggage with the hotel until 17:00....The hotel did NOTHING until I called.....It is the passport I left in the hotel, not the clothes, or small things which I may not use for a while!!!!!! It is the 1st time I left the passport in the hotel so I don't know what the other hotels do on this occasion. But being a hotel famous for or proud of the service to the client, I can only say it is definitely NOT up to my standard."
373,Date of stay: January 2014,40,WOw Hotel at WOW High Prices,"after a brief visit this hotel is one that does tick most boxes however it costs a small fortune to stay,eat and drink at this location,the deco is world class,a bit dated but all in the right theme and spirit that they portray ,great experience,very busy and service was exceptionally good,very quick,effective and tables cleaned immediately née vacated ,well worth a visit if your in town and the bathrooms well lets say its worth a visit!!"
374,Date of stay: January 2014,40,A real treat,"We decided to treat ourselves and end our Far East trip at the Peninsula, we arrive around 9p.m.and there was one person on reception who was dealing with someone else, and she did not acknowledge us and we waited for around 5 minutes, then finally someone else came over to look after us. We were taken to our room on 21st floor with an incredible view of Hong Kong Island, all the buildings were lit up. We were shown around the room and there is a coffee machine, many teas but no herbal tea, as we only drink herbal we asked for some but were advised that they did not provide this and we would have to pay for it!! Not a good start!
The room had every gadget and socket you could want for even a nail varnish dryer, the bed was huge and very comfortable. All the extras one would like (except herbal tea!) The next day the Front Office manager did organise the tea for us complimentary!
The swimming pool was amazing, all beautifully done with incredible view of Hong Kong island, there is a sauna, steam, Jacuzzi and the staff to very helpful. We had breakfast here one forming overlooking the city and river - amazing. it is a city hotel so very busy, the lounge area in on the ground floor serves afternoon tea and they allow around 30 people to stand a wait until there is a table, this makes the lounge very crowded and not somewhere as a resident you would wish to sit. overall the hotel is fantastic, they do need to improve on the above. We paid for a harbour view and this was stunning, I would really recommend it."
375,Date of stay: September 2013,50,I will give 6 stars if there is such an option.,"I think there is no doubt that The Peninsula Hong Kongs one of the best hotels in the world. But let me share my experience with you.

We ordered to be picked up by the Rolls Royce from and to the airport. If you would like to splurge, I recommend this pick up service. Why not! :-) We stayed at the Grand Deluxe Harbour View room. It was amazing that we got the famous Hong Kong light show every night from our room exclusively and effortlessly. So we did not need to go out to see the light show. Although we went out to stand by the harbour and watch the light show from outside on our first night.

I love the (what so called in The Peninsula website) LED touch screen wall panes. It controlled everything from tv, lights, curtain, temperature, until the ""do not disturb"" sign. You can check this out in their website. The dimension was (more less) like a thicker iPad. Very nice and handy. We had 3 in our room. One at each bed side and one at the office desk by the window.

The bathroom... Was a magic!! We could watch tv whilst bathing, there was mood lighting (woow!) and we could choose which music that we wanted to hear from the panel next to the bath. Amazing!

The little sofa on the left hand side to relax and read was lovely and we had a dining table in the room. There is a room layout drawing in their website that you can see, it is exactly like our room.

In addition, we ordered quite a lot of in-room dining. My favourite was the noodle and dumplings soup. The Korean glass noodle was good too. Breakfast was excellent. We tried to have breakfast both at The Lobby (where the famous afternoon tea is) and at The Verandah. The Lobby was more à la carte and The Verandah was buffet. The fresh made (in front of you) congee (Hong Kong porridge) was fab. One could choose what meat that one wanted. I could eat dim sum as much as I wanted too :-) as one of my targets when I was there was to eat as much dim sum as I could in Hong Kong.

Last but not least, I love the flower wallpaper on the left hand side of our room. Classy."
376,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Iconic hotel that lives up to its reputation,"We stayed at the Peninsula for one night in Nov. 2013 and I wish we had stayed a week! The room was gorgeous -- very sleek, modern decor, with an iPad that controlled everything from the drapes to the lighting. We were in the old building, which has an amazing view of the light show. The room was spacious, with an entry foyer, separate bathroom, and spacious bedroom. The staff was helpful without being intrusive. We took advantage of the spa, which you should NOT miss. It is attached to the indoor pool, which has a roof deck with views over the harbor. We watched the lightshow from there and it was totally amazing. Expensive, but TOTALLY worth it!"
377,Date of stay: December 2013,50,An Oasis from the Hustle and bustle of Hong Kong,We stepped into the foyer to be greeted by a Grand Piano being played beautifully the decore took your breath away such a change of pace from the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong.. The staff were very helpful and attentive. My Brothers wedding party had stayed the night before in a suite which was very modern and well equiped with views across Hong Kong Harbour. The staff were very attentive and ensured all the wedding guests were looked after. The Rolls Royces looked spectacular with the roses and nothing was a trouble.
378,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Relax and Fly Experience - Peninsula Spa and China Clipper,"My husband and I have lived overlooking the Peninsula for 3 years. We have watched the helicopters go in and out! I had a friend who did the ""dine and fly"" experience, so I checked out the website for costs, etc to book this for my husband's birthday.

Well, I stumbled upon the Relax and Fly experience. First, this is NOT an inexpensive idea...so for the same price as the dine and fly...I booked Relax and Fly...b/c for the money...we got almost an entire ""staycation"" at the Hotel.

We were greeted warmly and efficiently by the Spa staff. We had an hour to relax in the saunas and relaxation suite. We were then escorted to our spa treatments...one hour massage and one hour facial. After that, lunch at the pool (and we had a nice amount of time...no rush), then we were met and escorted upstairs to fly.

Our only downside was the weather literally moved in and our flight was cancelled, but having lived here..we a) saw it happen b) know this is very common .

The staff was apologetic but why fly when you can't see anything? We rescheduled the next day for later in the week...when I called, the Spa staff knew what was happening, took the info, confirmed our new flight and 3 days later, we were again met, escorted upstairs.

The flight staff was terrific...we got pictures on the roof before we went out. When we were finished with our flight, my husband was gifted a beautiful book regarding the history of the hotel since his birthday was ""interrupted"" by weather!

Like I said...this was not an inexpensive gift...however, it was an excellent experience. I really think people who live in HK need to give themselves this gift...even if just once!"
379,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Elegant hotel,"We stayed at this wonderful hotel in January we had a suit and our daughter had a superior room just beautiful
The service was top class in every area of this hotel
I think it would of been one if the best hotels we have ever stayed in
The beds were so comfortable
The bath rooms were large
If we go back to honk kong we would stay alway stay the peninsula don't forget to get pick up in the rolls it's a must"
380,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Impressed with the renovation,"This was my 2nd stay at the Peninsula Hong Kong. My first stay there was about 7 or 8 years ago. The hotel itself has undergone a major renovation. Although, outside it has preserved the same elegant image, inside every room has changed entirely. Everything in the room is computerized. Hotel uses ipad to control lighting, sound system, TV, curtain and all sort of entertainment. There are 3 ipads in our room, they are within your reach. I have to say it's very convenient. Room layout is very well comparted. There is a door between the closet (which serves as an entrance) and the bedroom making us feel a sense of privacy. Bathroom uses space efficiently. Though it is small, we didn't feel cramped when we were using it at the same time. Bed is soft and comfortable. Window protect us from hearing the noise from the road outside. Though we were staying on low floor, we didn't hear a single honking from outside traffic (which I think was very unusual in Hong Kong). Location is very convenient, close to major shopping arcades and brandname shops. For breakfast, we decided not to eat at the buffet. We had it at the pool. View of the bay was great. There were only two of us. Staff were attentive however food were slow. Front desk was very helpful. We got a upgrade offer at check-in to a better room category on a smoking floor. Staff took us to the room to see if we would want it. We decided not to take the offer because somehow the gadgets in that room didn't function and the room (practically entire floor) was filled with cigarette smell. We were happy with the room we reserved."
381,Date of stay: April 2013,50,Would love to go back.,"I think what makes this hotel the best there is in Hong Kong, and one of the best in the world is it's staff and service. Whatever you want, the minute you want it.
So refined, excellent top notch restaurants, very good location. My hubby and I LOVED IT!"
382,Date of stay: October 2013,40,Not as good as they say,"We had high expectations as do most when staying at what it reputedly the best hotel in the world. Overall we had a good 2 night stay but it was not to as high a standard as it could have been.

+ve

*we got the Rolls Royce pickup from the airport. It costs around £120 and is a must - you will struggle to get a better airport transfer and it feels very special. The car floats along and even has wifi. If you go for it, you get ushered from the moment you get off the plane, through security and you feel like royalty.
*the location of the hotel is excellent for shopping and has a great vantage point for seeing the light show that's on at 8pm every night.
*Our room was recently refurbed (except the bathroom). The tech in the room was crazy - there's a tablet on each side of the bed to control everything from lights to curtains to aircon. You can book restaurants and much more through this too.

-ve

*We didn't feel like we were treated differently from passers by. For example, the Peninsula is a bit of a tourist destination and therefore is very busy but they treat you the same as someone not staying in the hotel. We struggled to book the restaurants we wanted.
*Breakfast in the lobby is over-crowded and impersonal. Everyone wants to experience it so it's busy and feels like the waiters are just going through the motions with tea cups not being put down on saucers correctly or cutlery feeling like it's being thrown at you. It's the detail that counts for a place with this reputation and it was completely lacking. Top tip though and once I mention this, it may spoil it. The pool bar has nobody in it and you can each breakfast there. The second day we ate there and it's on the 8th floor overlooking HK island. The food is identical to the lobby. Very peaceful and pretty amazing actually. They warn that the food may take longer as it comes from the main kitchen but it doesn't.
*we found the concierge pretty awful. I mentioned we couldn't get into the restaurants but it was also the spa. Not their fault but their line is '[alternative] would be better, yes'. It's frustrating to hear that time and time again as it clearly would not be better or I would have asked for it first time round. It's a language thing but should be addressed.
*we were looking for stuff to do and directed to the big bhudda - well worth doing but I have no idea why the concierge didn't tell us we could book online and queue jump. Instead we wasted nearly 2 hours queuing, which is crazy.

We'd stay here again but just think it can be better. It has a huge reputation but for us even some of the basics were lacking."
383,Date of stay: January 2014,40,Beautiful Grand Hotel but avoid the lower level. R,"Have to agree with all the comments I have read, exquisite hotel with amazing service and rooms but unfortunately it is 1:30am and I am still awake due to the thumping noise reverberating through the hotel coming from the attached Felix bar. Kind of takes away from the luxury experience.
Other than that, no complaints."
384,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Newly Refurbished = Luxe Stay!,"Where do I start - the pick up was top class in the green Phantom Royce Royce. We were offered chilled Evian from the car's mini fridge, and had a great chat to our driver, who did a quick intro to the HK shopping and dining out precincts as we passed them. Check in was a bit tedious as we had to wait in line - you would think that a 5 star hotel will have their own personalised check in at the room rather than standing in line for 20 mins. We only had a deluxe room, so it was quite small but sufficient, as we also had our toddler's bed at the foot of our bed. The refurbished room was modern yet still exuded old world charm, so it was done tastefully and beautifully. Our daughter even received the Peninsula bear together with their famous truffles as a gift, and everything, from her bedsheets to bathrobe to even her slippers bore the Peninsula bear motif, which was really cute.

Our room package included the famous Peninsula Champagne High Tea - and we were really lucky that we were guests of the hotel, as we made a booking for the high tea when we checked in. Apparently anyone else other than guests of the hotel have to line up - and boy the queues could be more than an hour's wait, so we were told by the concierge. The high tea was not to be faulted, service was exceptional, and mostly, my fussy eater daughter enjoyed sharing the high tea platter with us, which was great to see!

The gorgeous heated pool was another plus for us - even though it was indoor, it opened out to a big terrace so you can essentially see outdoors at the Kowloon harbour, and you can even sit out at the terrace having your lunch or a snack.

The buffet breakfast was absolutely top notch - done with so much class and such service, that i could sit there all day! There was nearly a waiter per 2 tables, so you never need to look around, once you start looking up from your meal, and turn your head, a waiter would literally be by your side, but done so discreetly that it wasn't a bother at all!

Lastly, for those who were not told by their check in staff, when you go shopping in the hotel's Peninsula boutique downstairs, make sure you let them know you are a guest of the hotel, and bring your voucher to entitle you to a 20% off your shopping! We were only told by the staff at the boutique, we weren't given the voucher, so we quickly went back up to concierge to request for ours - give us a great saving on some quality souvenirs!

I would definitely recommend the Peninsula for a special occasion as it is without doubt one of the top hotels in the world!"
385,Date of stay: April 2013,40,My holiday,"You should stay at this hotel....it was an awesome experience. When we reached there we were treated like royalty with their services such as the 'Welcome Drink' and the 'Complimentary American Breakfast', they also had a great SPA Their rooms were amazing...It is considered as one of the Grand Luxury Hotels out here and their check out time can be as late as upto 04pm which was a plus point for our connecting flight back home"
386,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Without Doubt one of the Top Hotels in the World,"Obviously I'm not the first one to recognise The Peninsula Hong Kong as one of the top hotels worldwide. It's consistently rated by the leading travel magazines as THE PLACE to stay and I can only confirm that. What makes this hotel truly stand out is its impeccable service. Yes, sure, the rooms are great but the same can be said about many other hotels. But The Peninsula is second to none when it comes to attention to detail by its staff. It also boasts one of the best locations in Hong Kong, amazing restaurants, stunning views of Victoria Harbour and the best afternoon tea you'll ever experience (although it's getting a bit crowded). Nevertheless, their hot chocolate is worth the wait."
387,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Refurbished and first class experience,"The hotel has been refurbished and combines old world ambience and service with the most up to date technology
The wi fi and technology is amongst the best I have experienced along with every convenience, old world luxury and superior service
The location is magnificent opposite the harbour and close to Kowloons booming malls
Everthing is at the touch of a button and appears with no trouble and very quickly
I can't wait to come back to combine the experience of the British Raj and new age China"
388,Date of stay: December 2013,50,The nicest place you'll ever stay,"If you can swing it, spring for the Rolls Royce pick up at the airport. They meet you practically at the end of the jetway. Then they took us from there by electric cart an endless distance to customs/immigration (we were then whisked through), to one of their custom Rolls. There can't be a better way. We took advantage of the ""round trip discount"" and left the same way. Hotel is off the charts. You will discover many amenities you've never seen before (at least we did, and we've stayed in some really nice places). We happened to be there the week they were celebrating their 85th anniversary, so we (along with all other hotel guests) were automatically invited (engraved invitation) to the celebration event on the actual evening. They pulled out all the stops. ""Value"" is relative. It is very expensive. But incomparable."
389,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Gracious in every way,"Lovely hotel with beautifully appointed & fitted out rooms, warm gracious service right from front desk to housekeeping. Every little request (& granted we didn't make too many) was attended to promptly & with a smile."
390,Date of stay: December 2013,50,World class,"Everything was perfect from the first to the last minute.

We where picked up at the gate in the airport with a club car, escorted through customs and immigration and a porter was waiting to help us with the luggage at the baggage belt (o.k., we booked the Rolls-Royce transfer service).
Check-in was done in the room and we even could do it at 8.30am in the morning (our flight arrived at 6.45).
Breakfast (1st floor buffet) is wonderful, the swimmingpool is phantastic, the ""Felix"" a must (not only the gent's toilets :-)
We also had dinner at the Chinese restaurant (excellent Peking duck) and we where the only Europeans there. All other guest where locals...
The room was stunning (Grand Harbour view). Not enormously large but full of gadgets. There are three tablets where you can control everything - from the lights and curtains, Radio & TV to the room service menu. They even stream radio stations from all over the world - we where able to listen all the time to our beloved ""Classic radio"" from Hamburg. The bathroom was wonderful - all white and green marble and large enough for two at the same time with seperate shower and tub and double vanity.

The Concierge service was very friendly and helpful - we had a lot of email exchanges before and they organised tickets, restaurants etc.etc.
All the staff is efficient, friendly and very well trained - as you would expect in such a hotel.

The entrance to the MTR (subway) is just opposite the back entrance and from there you get everywhere - very convenient!

Whenever we come back to Hong Kong we will stay at the Peninsula - it's on our favourite list now!"
391,Date of stay: January 2014,50,The Peninsula - superior in every way,"We have stayed at this hotel once before - a number of years ago now - and were completely blown away by the quality of the hotel and the absolutely excellent customer service. I am very pleased to report that the same levels of excellence are still present today. We stayed in an entry level room in the main building and it was absolutely beautiful. These rooms have been renovated recently and are utterly tasteful in design while at the same time being completely practical (for instance, having substantial amounts of storage space). You can control pretty much everything in the room (curtains, lights, room service etc.) via a tablet in your room. They also have internet telephones so that you can make international phone calls at no cost, and wifi in included in your rate. We used the pool area which is a real treat (you can watch the light show each evening from that area) and visited a number of the bars. The downstairs bar, Salon de Ning, was a particular highlight - an intimate bar with live music and beautifully designed. The Peninsula is more expensive than places like the Mandarin Oriental (where we also stayed) but it is superior in every possible way and worth every penny."
392,Date of stay: March 2013,50,Memorable stay,"My wife and I stayed here several years ago stopping over on a trip through Asia. We stayed on the 22nd floor penthouse with the finest view of the harbor. Our room view exceeded that of the Philippe Starck restaurant which was just below us! Couldn't figure out how to turn off the overhead music, ""love is a many splendid thing..."" but that was the ONLY qualm I had. Everything else was perfect and what every Peninsula guest deserves. Truly a respite for the weary discerning traveller. The spa was not spectacular but better than average. We had more relaxing reflexology treatments in a small alleyway establishment a few minutes away. There is no other place I would stay while visiting Hong Kong."
393,Date of stay: December 2013,50,"Amazing, possibly unbeatable hotel!","My wife and I stayed at the Peninsula for 2 nights on our way to Australia. From the moment we arrived we were greeted by amazing service and a wonderful room. Although its not cheap it certainly offers value for money if you are looking for something special. The iPad control system in the room worked a treat and we really couldn't pick fault.

It sets the bar high in the luxury hotel market!"
394,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Fantastic,"We spent three nights here on our way back to Australia from Europe. Everything from the greeting at the entrance through to the room, the restaurants, bars, facilities and service were first class. It is expensive but it is somewhere everyone should stay at least once. all of the staff seemed to genuinely enjoy their work.

The tablets in the room which control everything you need were great.

We will definitely stay here again."
395,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Exquisite,"My apologies now if I sound a bit in love with this hotel!

The deluxe rooms are a very comfortable size and with the harbour view make a very nice setting for dinner. They are kept virtually sterile every day with the turn down service adapting to your patterns- I was falling asleep around 1900 due to time zone differences- in the end they came early to set the room up, the maid introducing herself and to call housekeeping to send her back if I needed anything else. The room is very well appointed and the bathroom was a joy to unwind in with the TV and radio available while you have a bath.

Reception was friendly, helpful and efficient. The concierge were also very good after they managed to track down a Brush Calligraphy Master to do a bespoke item for me. The pool was a lovely place to be however the poolside 'restaurant' ruined it a bit for me as it obstructed the view out over the city skyline. The location is good but do not be fooled by the harbour view rooms- if you want to see the symphony of lights you are best walking to the promenade as I think the experience is lost through the windows.

The Lobby gets quite busy in the afternoon as people queue up for afternoon high tea, luckily guests of the hotel can make a table reservation and be seated straight away. Room service offers a 'limited' menu but the prices are not so savage, although I must have been the only one using it after the lady on the other end of the phone began saying hello again and asking how I was!

So in short as the title says exquisite, if the staff made more small talk like I experience in the Melia Dubai I think I would see no reason to go home, I hope the Peninsula Bangkok lives up to the same sky high standard."
396,Date of stay: January 2014,50,"Just go... that's all. Doesn't matter what for, just go.","I went because of James Bond and the green Rolls Royce and all I had heard.

I had lunch at 2pm in the foyer - and even then people were queuing for afternoon tea... don't know why because the tea was about as expensive as my very good, beautifully cooked and presented lunch. The service was fabulous, discreet, quick, unhurried, subtle.... lovely.

The best bits were - for me - the building itself 1920s colonial rococo, and the people watching. There is nothing more amusing than watching people staggering about laden with high-end shopping bags in weirdly ""trendy"" clothing.... ghastly brattish children indulged to the hilt; ancient wives clinging on to out-live their palsied husbands; trophy wives fearful of being out-trophied (and atrophied); happy rich young people on honeymoon..... the list goes one.

So, I would go for the experience. I suspect that the afternoon tea whilst popular is overpriced... my lunch seemed very good and well priced. Can't comment on the rooms as I haven't won the lottery.... I would gladly review the rooms, without bias, if the management were to offer me a freebie suite :)"
397,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Sleep Sweet in a Suite,"If I had to pick one thing that would keep bringing us back to this hotel, it would have to be the truly sweet sleep experience that the two of us both had.

Somewhat unusually, we had nothing to talk about at all about the quality of the bed, the pillows, the blankets, the individual bedside lights, the air conditioning in the room during sleep, the noises created when visiting the bathroom in the middle of the night, etc. These things all worked so perfectly well that I did not even notice it during the stay.

Service was, needless to say, impeccably accurate and responsive. Well before check-in, hotel staff e-mailed several times to discuss special requests. I had the impression that anything reasonable you ask for clearly and explicitly, they will get it done and make everything totally worry-free for you.

The first evening of the stay, we ticked the item ""extra ice bucket"" listed on one of the wireless computer pads in the living room, and then left the suite to go for dinner. Right there in the corridor someone was waiting to let us know we had two ice buckets in the suite. But ice was not listed on the wireless pad, nor did we bother to telephone for some, so we never got any.

Another small glitch was when occasionally both of us grabbed the wireless pads on our bedside cabinets and started randomly pressing the tabs on the touch-screen, we found ourselves unintentionally competing for control of the TV.

You got the feeling that spaciousness was a constant emphasis everywhere in the suite, whatever you happened to be doing in the living room, the bedroom, the dressing room or the bathroom, or even at the entrance foyer of the suite, where you got a second washroom.

The restaurants in the hotel were far too tempting for us to stick to our original privacy-oriented plan to go for room service at dinner time. Otherwise we might get to see some sort of a large dinner table moved in to occupy the over-sized space in the middle of the living room.

Traditional English breakfast at The Lobby restaurant was fine. Sipping the excellent morning coffee relaxingly, you wondered whether to join the long queue of tourists waiting for a table there to have the legendary afternoon tea of the Peninsula Hotel.

Harbour-view at the hotel means windows facing South. The deluxe harbour view suite we stayed in also had East-facing windows in the bedroom and in the bathroom, as well as a North-facing one in the bathroom. This meant plenty of sun coming in throughout the day, a welcoming feature during winter days.

At the South-facing windows, you get a view of the egg-shaped Space Museum down below forming a straight line with the turtle-shaped Convention and Exhibition Centre across the Victoria Harbour.

The East-facing windows give a view of the roof-top swimming pool of the Sheraton Hotel and, beyond that, the newer Tsimshatsui East area of Kowloon. The North-facing one gives a view of the rooftops of the Kowloon Hotel and the residential buildings in an older part of Tsimshatsui.

From the large elevated bath tub, you have a choice of looking outside the East-facing side or the North-facing side of the L-shaped corner window flanking the tub, or staring at the LCD TV screen positioned on the wall for someone lying in the tub.

A rare hotel with a distinct character, and one that you can totally rely on for quality in every aspect of a stay."
398,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Best in class- Fabulous experience,"Location of this property is bang on TST harbor in midst of tourist attractions.
Rooms are hi-tech, the hotel is elegant, beautiful--art work and flowers everywhere. And the rooms are great--everything's controlled from an iPad.
Just incredible.The staff were very accommodating and took every effort to help, One of best hotels I have every stayed"
399,Date of stay: January 2014,50,Possibly my favourite hotel in the world!,"We stayed here on the way back to London from NZ. The service starts at the door of the aircraft with very attentive staff to get you through immigration, collect luggage and into the complimentary limo. A real treat for us after a long flight to be met with two Rolls Royce limos! We landed very early in the morning and the only downside of the entire trip was that only 1 room was available for early check-in so we all (6) had to crowd into that to rest for a few hours.

The rooms themselves were absolutely first class with all sorts of gadgets and high end accessories. The level of fit-out and equipment is mind-blowing and I'm not sure I've seen better anywhere else.

Service throughout the stay was 5 star plus. Just incredible.

Sure, it is not a cheap place to stay, but all in it is well and truly worth every penny. Possibly my favourite hotel in the whole world so worth the cost!"
400,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Beautiful Setting-Great Location-Fabulous Ammenities,"We stopped at the Peninsula for a quick 3 days on the way to touring SE Asia. The hotel is ekegant, beautiful--art work and flowers everywhere. And the rooms are great--everything's controlled from an iPad:lights, curtains, TV. Power adapters for iPads, in a bedside drawer, fast WiFi and best of all, the phone has a VOI connection so you can call home for free!
We were upgraded to a room with a patio and a lovely view of the harbor. We saw a magnificent sunrise and an evening light show with lasers from the tops the skyscrapers across the water.
Food was good. Breakfast, part of our package, was great. A serve-yourself arrangement, there was everything you could imagine, from bacon and eggs to Asian and Indian fare.
The hotel was very convenient--we walked to the ferry and to nearby restaurants. The staff were very accommodating. And more high end stores with more amazing jewels and clothes. (HK is a destination for the extremely wealthy Chinese)
It was lovely."
401,Date of stay: December 2013,50,The most high tech room!!,"We stayed in the hotel for Christmas season in HK and we loved all the high tech stuff in the room. Plenty of controls, everything controlled trough the wireless pads, speedy wifi, etc.
Beside that, very nice location in front of HK , where you can see the evening light and sound in HK buildings. Nice restaurants and food. Service very attentive and courteous!
Choose any of the rooms facing HK!"
402,Date of stay: April 2013,50,Treated like Royalty...ish,Could only afford 1 night - an anniversary present to my wife but what a night. We opted to get the limo from the airport - that service actually started with a buggy from the plane! Checked in within the room. The room itself was controlled by Ipads and just summed up the term luxury. Added to that a superb view over Kowloon harbour.
403,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Spa Treatment beyond the 5 Star accommodation,"Speaks for its name and description. The Peninsula has never missed out a word on the description that they have placed on their media releases. What you see is what you really get and more. It has defined already what the new generation wants in their stay in posh hotel. The hospitality is prime and personalized. They have caught the attention of those that want to be pampered. What I appreciated the most of the hotel is how they ask questions in order to anticipate the needs in every guest. I have mentioned that I need to relax and stretch, they gave me a booking at the spa in order to release all the pressure. The therapist and attendant did a quick interview in order to get what I want. A wonderful and life changing first time experience at The Peninsula. No amount of words can best describe what I want to say. Breathtaking."
404,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Lobby Restaurant,"Amazing hotel!! Unfortunately VERY POOR service at The Lobby Restaurant for both breakfast and dinner. Rooms recently renovated are amazing, specially grand deluxe harbour view. Overall excellent hotel, but quite disappointed with the lobby restaurant service"
405,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Fabulous Hotel,"We stayed here at the end of a cruise this fall and found it to be perfect. It is a lovely hotel with huge rooms and lots of amenities. I loved the Davi toiletries in the room. Also loved the layout of the rooms which offer lots of seating areas, privacy and closets. It was very comfortably appointed and had everything you could need from 3D glasses for movies to a nail dryer. The decor was very attractive and the bed was super comfortable. Can't say anything bad about it. The food was good. I really enjoyed tea which was served in the top floor bar/restaurant while we were there because of an event in the lobby. The views were amazing and I was so glad we went up there! The hotel is very conveniently located for sightseeing and catching harbor cruises."
406,Date of stay: January 2013,50,Amazing visit!,"The famous Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong was a fantastic place to stay. Steeped in history, the lobby is simply remarkable. Be sure to attend afternoon tea for a royal experience. If you have the time, be sure to take one of the green limos to the airport. Location is right in the heart of one of Hong Kong's shopping districts. Close to the metro MTA and at the base of a main boulevard of famous shops and boutiques."
407,Date of stay: March 2013,50,The best ever,"I have traveled the world for work and fun, this hotel tops the best hotels visited.

Service is off the chart, attention to detail is on another level food at its restaurants are exemplary.

The hotel is beautiful, a gentle reminder of colonial Hong Kong, Tea at the hotel is unforgettable

I would recommend this hotel everytime."
408,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Super excellence of Asian hospitability,"One of the best Asia s hotel....really amazing...concierge service is just superb....clever and impossible to stay without them at this hotel...they basically know it all what s going on in the city...
Rooms are huge and comfortable...bathroom is great and enough space for toiletries which is for a woman is a must."
409,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Top notch service and style,"Hong Kong Peninsula was a warm welcome for our first trip to Asia. The service and facilities are top notch. We opted for the hotel transfer via Rolls Royce, and were met at the arrival gate with an attendant and electric cart that expedited us through the airport to the limousine. Upon hotel arrival at 9:00 a.m., our room was awaiting us and complimentary tea service was delivered in short order. The room itself was recently remodeled - the technology was fully integrated (lights, entertainment, window treatments, thermostat, VOIP calling, etc), the room was covered in gorgeous lacquered cabinetry, and the bathroom was spacious and covered in marble. The views of Hong Kong from our room were lovely.

I was most impressed with the concierge services and they were invaluable in planning our three days In Hong Kong. Prior to arrival I consulted with the concierge via email, sending him my draft itinerary. He made suggestions to round out our experience, and recommended the most efficient schedule to optimize our time, in addition to securing the outstanding dining reservations. Once we arrived, the concierge team quickly and efficiently assisted in making modifications and in helping us navigate in city transportation.

Included in our room rate was the breakfast buffet, which was the best selection and quality that we have enjoyed at an in city hotel. We also enjoyed afternoon tea in the lobby. Our final night we changed plans to eat on property at Felix. The restaurant was fully booked, yet the concierge arranged not only a table but one on the window. While the views of Victoria Harbor were spectacular, the food and presentation were a bit ""gimmicky"" for our taste. We did however enjoy michelin starred dining at Lung King Heen and Ming Palace, as well as casual lunches at Luk Yu Teahouse and Yung Kee.

If we travel to Hong Kong again in the future, we will definitely return to the Peninsula!"
410,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Arguably the Best Hotel in Hong Kong,"Had a quick weekend trip to HK and although the prices were at peak rates already, the Pen surely made up for it. We got a Deluxe Suite and it was very spacious - I like the walk in closet - something you don't usually get! Adivse: listen to the restaurant suggestions of the concierge. Everything that was recommended to me was excellent!"
411,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Amazing spa,"I didn't have the pleasure of staying at The Peninsula however I did make reservations for the spa. I would throughly recommend a visit to the spa. The staff are friendly, efficient and very attentive while the facilities are second to none.

The reception on floor seven has changing rooms which themselves are equipped with a hot jacuzzi and a cold plunge pool. There is also a small sauna and steam room, all of which is immaculately clean.

If you have also booked a spa treatment you can use the facilities on floor nine which include a large sauna with a window over looking Hong Kong harbour which is amazing. There is also a crystal steam room, relaxation room and an experience shower which needs to be seen to be believed. The facilities are separate for male and female guests.

The treatments are really good value but do book well in advance to be sure of getting the time slot you wish."
412,Date of stay: December 2013,50,Great memory for 85th Anniversary Celebration 2013.,"A magnificent palace ideally located at the heart of the most vibrant part of Hong Kong, the Peninsula Hotel is a unique place to stay at Hong Kong and feel that you are at noble hotel.

A place where in contemporary comfort and elegance meets the silence, sophistication and kindness of classic culture.

Embebed in the atmosphere of luxury that is the very soul of this establishment are the amazing services , the pool terrace the outstanding bars and the restaurant with new culinary concept .All of them combining style and contemporary chic with an impeccable service attentive but not intrusive that makes the experience of the hotel more than unforgettable, memorable.

Because beyond the elegance and glamour of The Peninsula what it is truly remarkable is the personalized care of the guest, the kindness and consideration, the attention to details .

Everything reflects a philosophy and a very special art of living .

A pleasure to repeat indeed. We will come back !!!!"
413,Date of stay: December 2013,50,the best in hong kong,"There are many excellent hotels in Hong Kong, but there is only one that has been at the top for almost a century. I have stayed here many times and each time the service is impeccable. Not only that, this hotel IS Hong Kong (although it is on the Kowloon side of the city), it has been part of its history for 85 years. The location is unbeatable, the views are unforgettable (you do need to pay the extra for the harbor view), and the atmosphere still has this little bit of colonial Britishness. The rooms have all been renovated and now have a modern look but very much in style with the hotel, instead of the somehwat dated classic look of before. The beds are huge and extremely comfortable. Lights, curtains and TV are all electric but very simple to use. And, a great extra: the phone in the room uses VIOP so all calls are free. The bathrooms are unchanged but they really didnt need any; they are still very large with deep tubs, separte showers and two sinks. The gym is expansive and well-equiped, there is a good swimming pool. Many restaurants, and a (admittedly very crowded) high tea on the main floor (a big tourist attraction clearly, so I would avoid that). On the 28th floor the bar with a great view designed by Philippe Stark, worth the visit. All in all, no doubt one of the classic luxury hotels in the world and one of the very best."
414,Date of stay: December 2013,40,Disappointed with the service.,"Beautiful hotel..I went to the peninsula for afternoon tea. It was extremely busy and we had not booked the lounge. Staff then suggested the verandah which was busy too. They refused to say what the wait may be. They then suggested we try the felix on the 28th floor which is apparently accessed by a different elevator. We had a 2 year old in a buggy and my 67 year old mother and we spent 20 minutes going back and forth to find the elevator we needed.
The felix has mind blowing views but again the service was very poor. Apparently, they can't do cheese sandwiches for vegetarians! Had to ask thrice for a refill of my cup of tea..."
415,Date of stay: November 2013,50,It's always a risk...,"Choosing a big established 5 star city hotel can seem like a safe choice, but so often they're trading on past glories. Too long since the last refurb, dated with the food offering, robotically institutionalised staff, the whiff of naffness seeping from every pore.

Not so at the Peninsula. I'd read about the Peninsula and its fleet of Rolls Royces since I was a kid. I didn't have any recent personal recommendations so I checked out Tripadvisor and it was still highly rated so I took the chance.

I loved that everything worked seamlessly. We were met at the door of the plane by a hotel representative and a buggy, not sure if that's standard. At first I felt this was unecessary (we are not invalids) but by the time we had driven what seemed like a mile through Hong Kong airport I really appreciated it. We were accompanied through customs and baggage reclaim and handed over to another representative who took us to our waiting green Rolls Royce.

Our arrival 30 minutes later at the hotel was followed by further handovers until we were comfortably in our room on the 27th floor overlooking the harbour. The extra cost for a harbour view is so worth it. The room very cleverly uses its approx 550 sq ft to give a separate dressing area, sleeping, sitting and writing areas, a small dining table and luxurious marble bathroom. The room looked newly fitted and appointed with the extreme precision of a luxury yacht. Modern lacquered wood furniture and fabric wall coverings all very high spec. Everything was controlled by electronic pads scattered around, even above the bath. They all worked and were straightforward to use.

Tea and coffee making facilities, free wifi and even free telephone calls if you press the Internet calls button on the phone. We didn't get to try any of the restaurants except for breakfast on the first floor which was exceptionally well laid on with a wide range of choices. Most city hotels in this league have an indoor pool but they're generally quite gloomy. Here they've given a double height space on the 7/8th floor with open glass the whole length of one side onto terraces overlooking the harbour. Clean classical design with white marble columns make this a very pleasant space to spend time in. The hotel is also well placed for dining at several good restaurants in One Peking Tower, shopping on Canton Road, and taking the Star Ferry across to Hong Kong Island. Extremely courteous staff ensured a very happy 3 nights here."
416,Date of stay: September 2013,50,Grand old place,"It has been updated recently and the rooms were extremely nice and large. We had a room overlooking the harbor and the view was beautiful. Service was good. The amenities were very good. International tv, wifi, good food. Free long distance, to anywhere, was wonderful."
417,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Simply the best in Hong Kong,"Only if you cannot afford, simply the best hotel in Hong Kong . No other hotel can compare. Wifi , shower, bed , pillow , air condition , tv, service , from roof to floor , nothing but the best. Easy to get around , close to MTR. All the best restaurant inside the hotel."
418,Date of stay: December 2012,50,Why not the best??,If your travels have you heading to Hong Kong for a stay why not stay at one of the best hotels in Hong Kong? I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and this is one hotel that I look forward to staying at. First of all they have THE best service....no questions about it. The doormen are dressed in white to welcome you to the lobby and the service doesn't stop!! Be sure to get a room that looks over the harbor and you will just be mesmerized by the view. Regarding the rooms...all I can say is a great night's sleep and NO WORRIES. You can safely walk from the hotel to any type of entertainment or food that can be found anywhere in Hong Kong. It is the best hotel that I have ever stayed at.
419,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Our favourite urban hotel in the world,"We were back after two years and had the pleasure of staying in their recently renovated rooms. There is something about the Peninsula Hong Kong that makes it very special, from the moment the impeccable white-dressed doorman welcomes you in the lobby. Service is really the best we have ever experienced (even by normally high Asian standards). The new rooms are fabulous with a very modern decor (and amazing technology) keeping an elegant hint of Asia. And swimming on the 8th floor overlooking HK island is priceless... Still our favourite urban hotel in the world."
420,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Most amazing of 13 five star hotels we stayed in SE Asia,"Hotel has everything except affordable restaurants. We were in 22nd floor harbour view and could not have been better. Great view, large room, every amenity to include 3 iPads for controlling all lights, tv, and curtains. Delighted with our stay. Nightly light show was great. Used great fitness room everyday. Pool was excellent. Great location for seeing Hong Kong. All the Rolls and fountain and pi k lighting for breast cancer awareness just makes it special. Plus free international calls with direct VoIP Wifi best of any hotel we have stayed. Amazing"
421,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Hong Kong Must visit attraction,"Whether you choose to stay at The Peninsula or not, it should be one of the places in Hong Kong to visit.

Despite being the oldest hotel in HK, this is its 85th year, you'd be forgiven for mistaking it for being the newest!

They have renovated all the rooms, with all mod cons imaginable. My standard sized room had no less than three cordless phones, which through VOIP, meant all calls including international, were FREE! Word of warnng though, remember to activate the VOIP system, otherwise you will be charged!

Aside from the cordless phones, there were also three tablets, which controlled the curtains, drapes, Air Con, the 3D TV, Blu-ray player, as well as enabling me to order room service as well!

As if that's not enough, there's also an HDTV in the bathroom!

The room is also equipped with a coffee maker, nail dryer, power charger, etc.

On a day that I wanted privacy, in order to contact me to do housekeeping, a note was discreetly put nder my door. OK nothing special.

But I was also sent a message via the tablet - fair enough.

What was most surprising was a fax was sent to me! Yes I had an all in one fax, printer, photocopier and scanner in my room!

What more can they provide? They even had 3D glasses and cordless headphones!

If you're into gadgets, definately check out (in!) The Peninsula!"
422,Date of stay: November 2013,40,An over rated icon. Worth a look,"Rolls Royce from airport, what's not to like?

Check-staff were like automatons: if you went off their pre-program they could not understand English . Lobby area is a massive restaurant with no soft furnishings or areas to relax. This hotel is a destination for Hong Kong residents, so they obviously discourage casual visitors but, in so doing, they have turned it into a mausoleum.

There is no joy in this hotel, from the staff or from the patrons, smiles are in short supply . It is simply a massive money-generating machine, and the prices throughout reflect this. The staff are clearly not empowered, to the point they seem fearful.

The room was outstanding; possibly the most technologically functional room we have seen. iPad devices control lights, climate, curtains, audio/tv,access all hotel facilities, messaging, weather info etc! The room has concealed espresso machine, fax, nail drier, drop down mirrors, portable phones with VoIP . Huge bed and double basin bathroom with bath and separate shower. A/c was one of the most effective ever. 8 or 9 restaurants of various genres, plus a cocktail bar. Apart from the spa/pool,
there is nowhere to relax in the hotel during the day except your room.

It is a functional business hotel with an iconic status. Standards are high but I would not suggest staying here more than 2 nights: it is hardly a home from home!

Truly a hotel of contrasts that will suit some people but not others. Glad we went but won't be returning."
423,Date of stay: June 2013,50,"Expensive, but worth it!","I love The Peninsula Hong Kong! Aside from the fact that it's rooms are some of the most luxurious that I have ever stayed in and the service is top notch, I love having tea at the hotel. Even on business trips when I have been staying at other hotels, I have always made it a point to have tea at The Peninsula. There's no better place in Hong Kong that I have discovered. I also love the location of the hotel. I usually stay on the Hong Kong-side for business, so when traveling for leisure, I enjoy staying in Kowloon. The proximity to IFC, the various markets and some of the best restaurants in the city makes staying at The Peninsula an easy choice."
424,Date of stay: November 2013,50,A Room with a View...and Everything Else,"A minute from the Promenade on Kowloon's waterfront is the 1928 vintage Peninsula hotel. Just the sight of this building will tell you it has history (World War 2 especially, oh and a scene from the Dark Knight was filmed here) and the Rolls Royce Phantoms in front tells you that your wallet may not be happy with you...until you see the views of the harbor from your window.

Ordinarily, i'd dock points in a review based on price - after all, price does matter. I can't do that here. When you set foot in your room, you will see where the money went. The Peninsula Hotel redesigned itself to be a unique mix of old world style and modern technology.

Everything in your room runs through a table computer - temperature, curtains, lights, even the room service menu. The controls are simple and intuitive, making for easy acclimation and understanding of how to get the most out of your room. VOIP phones are included, allowing for easy (and free) international calls. Needless to say, the folks at home are also fans of this feature.

The furniture is comfortable and stylish in a very professional manner without being intrusive or ostentatious (cough cough, i'm talking about you - Burj al Arab). The minibar is in a cabinet below the television with a second minibar in the bedroom furniture if you are in a suite. The electric/broadband outlets pop out of the table at the push of a button, as does the vanity mirror in the bedroom. Your desk comes fully stocked with a printer/fax/scanner and a full assortment of office supplies. (not just stationary but that stapler that is frequently needed but never around)

The bathroom is a marble marvel, with a television and speakers in view of the bathtub.

Service was excellent with a representative from guest relations conducting check in at your room to explain the features and answer questions. Upon entering the room, I was greeted by a complimentary fruit basket and jar of chocolates from their boutique (more on that later). An hour later, room service showed up with a slice of cake as i'd had a birthday the day prior. That is the kind of service that brings repeat customers.

The hotel has several restaurants with varying styles of cuisine and dress codes. The hotel also has a three floor arcade with a number of high end shops with price points matching that of the hotel.

For tourism, the location couldn't be better - you're right next to Nathan Road with all of the shopping within a few minutes walk. (more importantly: Outback Steakhouse is just across the street)

Overall, you're going to pay for this hotel but you will get what you pay for."
425,Date of stay: November 2013,40,The Peninsula Experience!,"It's a bit of a legend isn't it, so everyone's heard of it, so half of Osaka and Shanghai is queueing up for tea. Although impeccably luxurious and old enough to ooze old money class, the new money is patiently waiting their turn in the beautiful lobby for a £26.44 cup of tea and cakes because it's in all the guide books, it's spoilt it really, but that's tourism for you.

A suggestion, walk past the madding crowd, up the stairs opposite the front door, turn left and get served instantly in the civilised atmosphere of the lovely Bar. Heaven!"
426,Date of stay: October 2013,50,expensive but worth the stay,"i stayed in ‘pen” as this hotel is affectionally called by the locals ,

Upon arrival, an airport concierge greeted me and escorted directly from the air bridge to immigration by a buggy and After clearing immigration, a porter assisted with the luggage and straight to their legendary rolls royce limousines.

check in was very slow as only 2 guys were checking in and many guests waiting to be check out….since the time was 12.00pm and since my rooms was not ready i was told to wait.
i got the room at around 2.00 pm , the room was nice and clean ,
since i had to rush to the meeting dint have any chance to eat in any restaurant but had breakfast in the morning which had a huge spread ,
my check out was smooth ,
this hotel is expansive but worth the stay ."
427,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Luxury worth the price,"You need to get over the sticker shock, but then again, every decent hotel in Hong Kong is now very expensive. The good news is that the hotel delivers value, if that is the right word, worthy of the nose-bleed price tag. The hotel has a very much of an old-Hong Kong luxury feel, and yet the rooms are all updated for the best of modern amenities. The hotel is truly an oasis from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the city. Of course, one of the best things the Peninsula is the level of service. No question or request is too small. From the moment of check in until the moment they hail a taxi for your departure, the staff goes out of its way to make you feel special. I generally prefer to stay on the island side of Hong Kong, but I will make an exception for the Peninsula...especially when somebody else is paying for it."
428,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Magnificent Hotel,"Staying at the Peninsula has been an experience second to none. We spent four wonderful nights in quiet luxury overlooking Hong Kong Island,with night lights superb.The rooms have been totally refurbished and now have state of the art i-pad controlled functionality while the Hotel retains it original glory. High tea is still a treat,although it is quite overcrowded.Would suggest they separate and offer preference to residents."
429,Date of stay: November 2013,50,Fantastic Hotel,"We stayed here for one night on a weekend away. We had very high expectations and I must say they were met and surpassed. Amazing staff, rooms, service and atmosphere. The Spa is fantastic and the meal we had at Felix was great. I only wish we had more time."
430,Date of stay: March 2013,50,Best of the Best,"If your looking for an iconic Hong Kong Hotel with old world luxury you cant go past this place. It is excellent and I could not say a bad word against the Peninsula. The service is exceptional as is the location, rooms and history of the place - This is hands down HK's best Hotel and probably my favourite worldwide."
431,Date of stay: September 2013,50,Outstanding Hotel. Faultless service.,"I cannot praise this hotel highly enough. The service was the best I have ever experienced anywhere and that includes the Ritz in London and Paris. If you want a document printed such as your boarding pass you can just email reception and everything will be printed and waiting for you or delivered to your room instantly. Rooms are equippped with three ipads that control the lighting, curtains, TV, video library, room service, door privacy etc. Dressing tables with well lit mirrors have drawers with decent hairdryers that plug in in the drawer so no need to hunt for a plug mirror combination that works! Toiletries are plentiful and of quality, the stationery provided includes staplers and post it notes, a printer and fax! Free international calls, yes free International calls were a welcome suprise, good free internet connectivity. Superb rooftop cocktail bar with interesting well served cocktails. We paid for and enjoyed the Rolls Royce Phantom airport transfers - they meet and greet you off the plane, at the airbridge and then escort you through passport control, through to baggage and then to the car, which also had wi fi! Breakfast was served... what a delight. No going back and forth to the buffet, and the tea was outstanding. Bone china cups. Expensive, of course, but worth every penny."
432,Date of stay: November 2012,50,"Hong Kong, The Peninsula Hotel","Absolutely Lovely Hotel. Stars and decadence. The first thing you notice are all of the roll-royces parked in the front with gentlemen feather dusting each one. Upon entering the lobby is filled with shadows of the outside world thru the towering glass. Impeccable service, food, room, etc. I'm not sure if each room has this be we had our own butler who answered our every need and question within seconds. Absolutely one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in. Fabulous!"
433,Date of stay: October 2013,50,I would live here if I could afford it !,"Just back from 10 days at The Peninsula. What GREAT service and wonderful food. We tried all the restaurants but the Gaddis, only because everyone but myself wanted Asian food. The buffets in The Verandah are just magical. We had meals from breakfast to dinner there and each meal was delicious and beautifully presented. Drinks or meals in The Lobby are great for people watching.

I think the room service might have been just a touch over the top. Not to say there was anything wrong with it all, quite the opposite. But one can be a bit too pampered.

The rooms are a gadgets lovers paradise, there is a touch screen for everything. The fresh fruit plate everyday and the nespresso machine were nice touches. There is no need to take any adapters it is all provided, as well as office equipment.

The beds are very comfortable the only complaint I had were the pillows, which were way too soft for my liking. Also, you can not just have a sheet over you since they only have doonas on the beds. I suppose I could have asked to have the inside part taken out. Our room on the 21st floor was totally quiet except for a ding from the elevators from time to time.

The bathrooms are to die for. But, I can't understand why someone would want to sit in the tub and watch tv when they are in a city like Hong Kong. There are two different types of robes, Oscar de la Renta toiletries, and huge towels. His and hers sinks as well as a separate shower.

It is probably the best of the five star hotels we have stayed at over the years and would not hesitate to return. My only regret is that I never went up to check out the pool area, which our friends said was fantastic."
434,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Another Wonderful Stay,"Just returned from a short family visit of just two nights. The staff, as always, remembers that we are return guests. Although housekeeping service was delayed a bit on our arrival, which was at 9 pm, the staff graciously apologized and offered tea in the lobby. Housekeeping was again late in cleaning at 5 pm the following day, but quickly came and tidied up. The hotel was very, very busy so this was understandable.
Love the location, the staff and the friendly and not pretentious service."
435,Date of stay: October 2013,50,True luxury and perfect service in Hong Kong's most iconic hotel,"We got married at the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong in October 2013. The hotel not only met our expectations but exceeded all of them. The service was exceptional and even though this was wedding season in Hong Kong with numerous weddings happening over the weekend, we were made to feel like celebrities by the hotel staff. No request was too much. The suite we stayed in was beautiful and had a glorious view of the harbour. I like a taste of luxury from time to time as a rare treat but the experience was do fantastic I look forward to returning here for another stay in the near future."
436,Date of stay: May 2013,50,Brilliant! get the Rolls Royce transfer,"This was fantastic! off the plane, collected at the gate whisked through, our bags collected for us and transferred by Rolls to the hotel. In room check in with tea and fruit served. Beautiful rooms, fantastically appointed. A beautiful old world hotel full of charm. Watching the line for the high tea in the afternoon is entertainment in itself. A wonderful hotel in a class of its own. I would come back to Hong Kong just to stay here again!"
437,Date of stay: January 2013,50,"Graciously, still there",The Peninsula is a benchmark as well for the hotel industry as for the high end travelers. A must for everybody who wants to experience the true and genuine hospitality. This historical landmark of Hong Kong will give not only the perfect stay but will make part of the history of this amazing city.
438,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Exceptional Class in Hong Kong,"The Peninsula Hong Kong is without exception one of the truly best hotels in the world. The rooms have every technological amenity one could want and are designed with excellent materials and sophisticated color palettes. The Spa is truly remarkable! When one arrives at the pool you can't help but be taken aback by the size, design, and windows looking over Victoria Harbor. Make sure to enjoy an afternoon meal or snack by the pool. The service at the hotel is world class and they bend over backwards to help make your experience memorable. For example, I told my daughter I would bring her a Peninsula Tea Set but when I went down to the Peninsula boutique they informed me that they were sold out. I did not want to disappoint my daughter so I had a conversation with the concierge and hotel manager. Within a few hours they delivered a brand new tea set to my room--apparently house keeping keeps extras in case guests break them in the hotel. Finally, while it is touristy to have afternoon tea in the formal entry room, we had a great experience! Overall, the Peninsula Hong Kong is remarkable and was tied for our favorite hotel in China--along with Amanfayun."
439,Date of stay: October 2013,50,Experience,"Outstanding service. Great restaurants, Gaddis, Felix, Spring Moon, try the Peking Duck, mmm.
The Rolls Royce transfers were simply perfect. Must be one of the worlds greatest hotel.
The situation on Kowloon is perfect. Right next to the famous Star Ferry.
Last time we stayed on Hong Kong island but Kowloon is where it's at."
440,Date of stay: September 2013,10,"Grand Old Hotel, but Got Sick at Restaurant","The Peninsula is a grand old hotel, recently remodeled, on the channel between Kowloon and Hong Kong island. The laser light show at 8PM is worth seeing, so select a room overlooking the channel. The room was very nice. We ate in the lobby dining room one evening, and the meal was very good, with one exception. Both of us became ill with the typical symptoms of bad food later in the evening. The hotel staff seemed unconcerned, when we point out our bad experience."
441,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Fantastic stay and wonderful views of Hong Kong Island,"The service and food was excellent as were the recently rennovated rooms which are sleek and modern. The swimming pool and spa area is wonderful - a great place to relax. Personally i think Kowloon is the best place to stay as you have the great views back over to Hong Kong island. The hotel is in a great location so easy to walk to the boats, restuarants and many shops.

Would highly reccomend this hotel!!"
442,Date of stay: September 2013,50,Not quite the same but still excellent,"This was our second visit to the Peninsula. The rooms have been updated since our last visit and it takes a bit of time to get accustomed to all the bells and whistles. While, fortunately, the marble bathrooms remain the same, the hi-tech upgrades and sleek furnishings have sucked all the charm out of the rooms. But, I will admit the nifty nespresso machine is killer!

We again chose a deluxe harbour view room and thoroughly enjoyed watching the activity in the harbour both day and night. The service remains impeccable with a lot of considerate little extras, such as tea delivered to our room after check-in, and daily fruit basket. We enjoyed breakfast at the Verandah each morning and the selection and quality of the food was excellent. We also ate at Felix (a return visit) and thoroughly enjoyed our meal. In an aside, the mens' bathroom has been remodeled; my husband asked one of the hosts about the change and the host had no idea what he was talking about.

All in all we enjoyed our 4 night stay and will return, once again to the Peninsula on our next trip to Hong Kong."
443,Date of stay: September 2013,50,All the money is the view,"we had the room 2009 and we saw a different Hong Kong. !!
The hotel is simply superb. the rooms are hi-tech and everything works with remote control
breakfast qite satisfactory and internet available either cable or wirless.
recommended."
444,Date of stay: November 2012,50,Number 1 in THE world,Will always be THE number 1 hotel in THE world in all aspects! Arriving from the airport and coming here is a dream ! Beautiful hotel with helipad on top! Rooms are spacious and marvelous ! Bar and stark restaurant are deffinately to recommend ! Thank you
445,Date of stay: June 2013,50,One of THE great hotels to stay,"From being welcomed off my flight, escorted through the airport bypassing the immigration queues to my waiting rolls Royce, to being greeted at the hotel door by my host David it was one of my great experiences.

The opulence of my suite and the general decor of the hotel makes it a hotel which needs to be stayed at at least once.

Breakfast with the Classic English tea service reminded me of years gone by.

The high tea with a string quartet was a highlight before getting back into the roller to go back to the airport.

A must for everyone at least once."
446,Date of stay: October 2012,50,Top quality and a galaxy of many color lights,"- Location: Very good. It is a once in a lifetime experience.
- Floor: 28th!
- View: Amazing night harbor view. It seems like a wall poster with a galaxy of many color lights.
- Level of food: high.
It is a unique experience to eat at Felix restaurant. I ate American Beef tartar with Mustard Mayonnaise and delicious Felix salad. The presentation was top notch.
- Service: excellent on all levels. The staff are all proud to be there.
- Decoration: high class

If ever you have the opportunity to eat at this great restaurant do it."
447,Date of stay: December 2012,50,"Simply ""The Best""","There is no better! This hotel comes no 1 I'm most best hotels in the world and it's easy to see why
From the amazing fountain and huge glass doors that are wafted open as you arrive to the sumptuous rooms and stunning decor there is no better - a bucket list hotel!
Afternoon high tea is a must in the foyer and must be booked well in advance!
Felix the restaurant on the top floor is my favourite restaurant in the world
Just do it you won't regret it!"
448,Date of stay: August 2013,40,Seven Days,"Decided to spend a week in Hong Kong and, following glowing TripAdvisor reviews, booked two rooms - one for my teenage children and the other for my wife and I.
We also choose the hotel's airport chauffeur option, which I would thoroughly recommend after a long flight. Being met at the gate and driven in a buggy by a guide through immigration, to your bags and straight to your waiting car is well worth the investment. The airport itself is massive so be prepared to walk up to a mile if you do not choose this option. It's also situated 45 minutes from the Peninsula.
We arrived early evening and had no delay in getting to our rooms. Welcome not as warm as we would expect - too formal and frosty.
Rooms were exceptional. We were placed in the tower on a high floor - great views.
Fantastic beds, furniture and lighting. Bathrooms absolutely brilliant.
There is a central entertainment control system based on a portable tablet design to help manage everything from anywhere in the room. Very problematic. You have to tap functions three or four times to work and the screen crashes frequently. If you do decide to use - be patient, especially if you have an iPad or a similar bit of kit. Changing channels etc is VERY frustrating.
Otherwise, everything else in our both our rooms was superb.
Lifts throughout the hotel are fast. Recommend you take time to discover all of the nooks throughout the hotels. There's plenty of high-end shops, restaurants and bars.
Breakfast on the first floor offer a excellent range of foods to cater for most tastes. Quite formal buffet - but there is a fault here. The staff are very intrusive. Clearing plates off your table under your nose and literally a second after you have finished. Several times I was STILL eating and the table was cleared. They fold your napkin for you when you leave the table for a juice or more food at the buffet. My advice is to stand well back for diners to relax, enjoy the surroundings and chill with the family. Especially in the morning.
We decided to take only 4 breakfasts out of 7 mornings because of this.
Hotel lobby is beautiful and busy with guests. There is a tea service in the afternoon that makes it extremely busy where non-residents are invited to 'Take tea at the Peninsula'. Try and stay well clear during 3-5pm as there are queues in the lobby, which make it difficult for you to walk in a straight line. It's noisy and we were barged three times.
Otherwise, you will find the door staff and the attendants in the front very hospitable and friendly. We stayed during refurbishments to the front of the hotel and experienced a number of near-misses for pedestrians outside as it was busy with cars and taxi's.
So watch yourself and young ones.
Didn't come across any management during our stay so cannot comment.
Hotel Spa is very relaxing and professional. Pool staff very friendly and helpful.
Enjoyed our 7 days in Hong Kong and the position of the hotel in Kowloon is great. Easy access to the metro, Star Ferry and Hong Kong island.
Lovely local people."
449,Date of stay: April 2013,40,Interesting,"We had a good stay here, particularly enjoyed the views and food, plus the service levels are what you would expect from this chain, we liked the chinese restaurant the best, particularly the crab and sweet corn soup"
450,Date of stay: October 2012,50,"""Without doubt, the finest Hotel in the world""","Having stayed at this Hotel, Man and Boy, over 100 times, I think I am qualified to rate this Hotel as the finest in the World. My Father first stayed here in 1958 and was a regular for many years and well known there too, to the Khadouri family as well as the then General Manager Felix Bieger, where the great Roof Top restaurant ""Felix"" takes it's name.

From the moment you arrive in Hong Kong and are collected by one of their famous British Racing Green Rolls Royce's, to the greeting of the front desk, to the wonderful orchestral teas in the lobby and to the wonderful meals at Gaddi's, Chesa and Felix, you are always welcomed by lovely friendly faces in crisp white uniforms.

As would be expected, over the years, staff have changed, but, I will never, ever forget the famous experience I had, when the Hotel was closed for further development and I was staying for once, elsewhere. I had to visit the Lobby, which was still open. As I walked through those lovely marble floors, I saw a young Concierge chasing after me calling my name. He handed me an envelope, ""this is your birthday card sir, it will save us posting it to England"", absolutely true!

Hundreds of 5 star Hotels have opened in the past 30 years and I haven't visited many of them, but without qualification I can say, this was and is the best in the World as it is old world quality and charm. Sadly, we have seen the likes of the Dorchester, Connaught and Savoy all change hands and in doing so have lost a little of that, but the great Peninsula just goes on and on as it's quality and service is inbred and will stay that way as long as the family remain owners.

Thank you Peninsula for being there for my Family."
451,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Wonderful stay,"We were a little ambivalent about staying at the Peninsula - we like staying at iconic hotels but sometimes (like the Plaza in New York) the reputation doesn't match the experience. On the whole we prefer boutique hotels (e.g. Fours Seasons in Sultanhmet) but in this case the Peninsula really exceeded our expectations. The staff were wonderful - we really enjoyed talking to Andrea at reception and the Maitre d at the Spring Moon. Afternoon tea was an experience (although nothing can match the Ritz in London!). Loved the Spring Moon and although breakfast is not really a meal we have very often we did eat at the Verandah twice - pastries melted in the mouth and who can resist steamed buns and dumplings for breakfast.

We had a suite and I was in raptures over how much thought has gone into placing of amenities - there were even two full length mirrors that can be swiveled to give a good back view - just little things that most hotels don't even think about. The suites with Harbour view are definitely worth it.

We had come over by ferry from Macau and had the Rolls Royce pick up and then return to the airport - well worth it for a very smooth transfer.

We tend to go to Europe via Singapore (and now Dubai with the Qantas changes), but we intend changing to some trips via Hong Kong just so we can stay at this beautiful hotel again.

One tip - if you like chocolates, explore the lower floor of the shopping arcade - the Peninsula has a chocolate shop with very nice truffles."
452,Date of stay: November 2012,50,What an experience,"This hotel is full of history and stories. Just one night there is a memorable and exotic experience. We had our own butler and movies in the bath and an amazing view of Hong Kong. The concierge helped us with our daily itineraries and made sure we were booked in for High Tea. The High Tea is famous and though pricey it is wonderful. We spent a lot of time in the hotel just enjoying the facilities that we had paid a lot for. This is really expensive so we only went for the experience but it was worth it.
So many attractions were within walking distance and the views were amazing all around there. I would recommend it to honeymooners or people celebrating with their spouse. Not really a place for kids."
453,Date of stay: June 2013,50,Sets the Standard for Excellent Service,"The Peninsula offers a perfect location, great food, historic ambiance and a modern luxurious room. But it is the very high level service provided by the entire staff that makes it stand out.
The outstanding service began with our ride in the Rolls Royce to the hotel. After 14 hours in coach to be met at the gate with a shuttle to take us to customs was such a treat. We were taken to a customs area with no line, something I have not experienced in Hong Kong before. Plus, of course the car was outrageous!
We were shown to our room to check-in by a woman from the front desk who provided a sincerely friendly and efficient welcome. She confirmed our dining reservation and arranged for a car back to the airport. The personal follow up note was charming. The hand made chocolates were a nice touch too.
Dinner at Spring Moon was of very high caliber. They do an amazing Peking Duck service. Good wine list and although pricey, it is worth it, especially if you are exhausted after a long flight.
The pool is beautiful--indoors, with an outstanding view. The pool service was quick and friendly.
We enjoyed our room service dim sum breakfast. They were prompt and friendly. The food was of very high caliber.
Our room was the Grand Harbor Deluxe. Two adults and a teenager fit in fine. The view was lovely--we did not want to leave the room. The bed was heavenly and the i-pad controls very efficient and fun to use.
Hong Kong has many high caliber hotels to choose from. I have stayed at the Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons and the Grand Hyatt. For a vacation stay, if you wanted to splurge, this would be my first choice. The Ritz Carlton may have more of a jaw dropping view but the Peninsula's service is consistently better, has a much better location for sight seeing and offers better dining choices. Comparing this hotel with the Four Seasons, it is a close race. Where the Four Seasons is ultra slick and clean and probably the best choice for business, the Peninsula is luxurious but a bit comfortable for the leisure traveler."
454,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Old World and New World Meet,"It was with anticipation and trepidation that the time finally came to try this hotel in Hong Kong. I had always wanted to try it mainly because of the history attached to it. The trepidation arose from staying at the sister property in Bangkok and being thoroughly underwhelmed and not understanding why it received all the rave reviews.

Let me say at the outset that I was not disappointed with the Peninsula Hong Kong.

The trip was booked through a particular travel company which meant some extra benefits including round trip transfers (in the Rolls Royce, breakfast and an upgrade). I was met at the aerobridge from my Qantas flight and escorted to immigration. No fast track available here and the representative (who is not from the Peninsula) meets you on the other side. They also help you with your luggage if you have any and then take you to meet the airport concierge. He then takes you to the waiting Rolls Royce and you are whisked away in complete silence. This process was wonderfully seamless.

My partner had already checked in the night before and had upgraded us further to a Harbour View Suite (apparently the Grand Harbour View Deluxe Room was very small but had a nice view). The hotel also managed to cope with the fact that we had three bookings but were able to keep the same room throughout – thanks to my travel concierge and the hotel for getting this right. We were met in the lobby and taken up to the room so I could check in and we were given a quick tour to explain the technology.

I have to say that the refurbishment is wonderful and the mix of the modern and Asian touches works perfectly. We were very much fans of the black wood done in a high gloss piano finish and the wallpaper which was made of fabric. The designer couch was also very comfortable and chic.

Now on to the technology in the room, it is everywhere and all operated through various panels or tablets. On a wall of each room there is a panel which operates the lights, air con and curtains. All very intuitive. In the living room and in the bedroom there are tablets which control the same functions but also operate the TV, Audio and DVD players. In fact you can select the zone so if you wanted to change the temperature in the living room but you are lying on the bed, this is all possible! There are also separate remote controls for the TV and DVD player if required and we used them as a couple of functions did not seem to work like getting a movie to play. Speaking of movies there are a number available for free through the TV. An excellent up to date selection. We also had a DVD player and were told that DVDs and 3D glasses were available. Probably the only gripe with the system is that the signal strength on the TV channels was not always great and we put it down to it being run through the internet. The only think you could not seem to do was order room service on the tablet!

The room itself I have already touched on in terms of décor. The view across the harbour is always amazing and only marred by the condensation on the windows. TVs in the bedroom and lounge room are BIG and crystal clear. The hidden Nespresso machine was great too. We had fresh flowers in the room, although one lot looked like a bowl of lettuce! We received some chocolates on one day but nothing on the other evenings. The bed was extremely comfortable and the grey linen worked even if it did have a bit of a prison feel to it!

We did hear odd noises during the night and during the day of scratching sounds and the pitter patter of little feet. Honestly it sounded like mice/rats running through the walls and ceilings. We did not report it but we both heard it!!

Bathroom is a decent size with two sinks although amenities are only placed on one side – very odd. Also water pressure is low and the shower took forever to heat up. You would not want to be in a hurry.

In terms of dining we ate at Gaddi’s on the first night. We had a great meal but it is not the best out there and not that inventive. This was noted when we dined at the Caprice at the Four Seasons two nights later. That said, kudos to the sommelier who was outstanding. We also ate at the Verandah for breakfast. The first day we had to wait for a table which was a little odd. Anyway the buffet spread is plentiful, interesting and fresh. We also did the traditional afternoon tea (included in our rate) and again this is fine but is really mass production and does not feel that special anymore. The lobby becomes very noisy. We also had breakfast in the lobby which was pleasant and a nice a la carte menu.

We did use the pool (which is indoor) one afternoon which is nice but a shame that it is indoors. Service was very average that day with a complete lack of service. I had to head up to the service area to ask for menus etc. This was certainly not Peninsula standard.

Our suite also gave us the use (on a first come first served basis) of a Mini Cooper with a driver. This was pretty neat and we had a nice drive around town to Cat Street and then the Goldfish market. Driver (Ricky) was fantastic. They also give you a mobile phone to call the driver.

We had the Rolls Royce back to the airport also which again was seamless.

This was a wonderful hotel that deserves its reputation."
455,Date of stay: April 2013,50,Grande Dame,"To understand the Peninsula you need to understand it's history as THE grande dame hotel of Hong Kong- where dignitaries mingled with the upper crust 85 years ago. All little girls aspire to one day walk in and take afternoon tea at the lobby or perhaps have their first french restaurant experience at Gaddi's. THAT kind of place.
Fast forward, the Pen is a successful chain worldwide. But none compares to the one in Hong Kong in my opinion. The staff are all so proud to be there, from the bellman to the housekeeper. We stayed at one of the suites on the lower floors, overlooking the harbor. The suite is bigger than my then apartment with a magnificent view. Their training program is one of the strictest and even in this day and age of declining service one has expectations of the Pen. Case in point- I sent a dress to be pressed and the adorable housekeeping lady who brought it back almost bowed to me had I not stopped her. Aside from the Mandarin Oriental, no other hotel has equal or better service in my opinion.
It is a once in a lifetime hotel experience and you should try it out and immerse yourself in the history if possible. It will bring you back to a more gracious era, even within the hustle and bustle of Hong Kong."
456,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Magnificent hotel,"Much appreciated the first class airport pick-up (straight from the plane through all formalities, and then whisked to hotel in ""Phantom"" Rolls Royce with Internet). Quite decent!
Wonderful atmosphere all over the hotel.
Enjoyed a smashing wine dinner at the FELIX top floor night club on first evening.- Food slightly similar to Noma in Copenhagen.
Service and settings/decoration of breakfast room is of high class and extremely comfortable.
Top class gym and pool.
My wife is insisting to repeat this stay another time."
457,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Can't Wait to Go Back,"Wonderful hotel, disastrous arrival as typhoon was coming ashore and had to go through kitchen entrance. Staff very helpful and accommodating as we were anxious for our daughter ( she was stuck in Bangkok - NEVER USE PAKISTAN AIR). The rooms are well appointed. Breakfast was satisfactory. Location was great."
458,Date of stay: July 2013,50,VIP experience!,"We booked via Centurion who had arranged one or two complimentary goodies !
It started at the airport when we were met after walking just 20 meters off the plane to be whisked through the airport on a buggy ,through security in minutes and met a Peninsula rep on the other side who escorted us and our luggage to an awaiting Rolls .
What a splendid grand entrance to the hotel ,check in was a doddle and we were guided up to our stunning room overlooking the harbour .
Extremely comfortable ,clean ,fresh,and yet very homely . Only one slight issue it was a struggle to work everything from an I pad , great idea but give me some old fashioned switches and buttons !
Bathroom is spacious and has everything you need .
Great spa,gym and pool . Fabulous complimentary afternoon tea with charming efficient staff ,always smiling .
Three nights was not enough we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and was quickly whiz zed back to the airport again in a Rolls ."
459,Date of stay: August 2013,40,"All is perfect, but...","Wonderful place, rooms are well furnished and full of amenities. the location is top and the hotel itself is a landmark of hong kong. Spa and swimming pool are great. Breakfast was ok. But... the check in was really a pain, we arrived around 1pm and they told us room could not be ready till 2pm, they ask my mobile number (i got a local one) to contact me back when ready (ok, never happened before in this hotel category, but we are in august and maybe someone make some mistake). I went out for lunch, but nobody contact me... at 3pm we decide it was time to see what happen, we head to the reception and they gave me the room key, I ask for a late check out as i had to take a flight in the evening and they refuse, in a quite a rude way. Nobody escorted us in our room (again never happened in this hotel category).
The staff, except the reception, were friendly and let us enjoy the rest of our stay.
Afternoon tea? better have it in the room. the one in the lobby is too crowd."
460,Date of stay: August 2013,50,A Great Place to Recharge,"Upon arrival at 1am, I was greeted in a courteous and professional manner and escorted to my room. Within ten minutes, a fruit plate and pot of tea were brought to my room. It was a great welcome, and really set the tone for the rest of my trip. No matter how strange my request (Intro Cantonese lessons, for starters), everyone at the hotel was incredibly accommodating. I can't say they were particularly friendly (one actually shooed me away from the lobby because looking through my bags was deemed ""unacceptable""), but they were very professional.

In terms of my room (Deluxe), it was fantastic and very thoughtfully designed. The bedside charger center, touchpads controlling lighting and temperature, and hotel restaurant menus were all convenient and easy to use. The decor is a very luxurious and cozy interpretation of modern Asian, and the blackout shades on the windows and comfortable beds ensure perfect sleep. The hotel's pool is probably the best part of the hotel, and I regret waiting until my final day to experience it. The best way to describe it is as the filmic depiction of heaven, and every guest at the Peninsula should at least drop by for a look.

Speaking of the hotel offerings, they are superb. My weekend lunch at Gaddi's was quite possibly the best meal I've ever eaten in my entire life, and I've eaten a lot of great food. The Peninsula also offers a wealth of luxury shopping destinations (Chanel, Prada, Hermes, and Tiffany stores are all located within the hotel), for those who are so inclined.

In total, my trip to the Peninsula was almost perfect. I hope to one day have an opportunity to return, but in the meantime will settle for memories of Gaddi's, the hotel pool, and my beautiful room."
461,Date of stay: August 2013,50,Care in details of your stay,"The deluxe room expressed the expertise of the designer and hotel's intention to focus in every details of guests' need to ensure their comfort. I was impressed by these details such as the in-room varieties of adapters and chargers, superb quality of bedding, lighting, entertainment. Unfortunately, something was wrong during reservation and we got a smoking room :( Other rooms were fully booked so we had to stay 2 nights in that room. Staff were very professional but i cannot say that they are friendly (from their eyes)"
462,Date of stay: August 2013,40,"Awesome hotel, bar n resto","A nice lobby hotel with helpful reception and awesome bar,
Great services. And tastefully chinese resto,
A room not really big but clean. Breakfast menu just standard, and convenient location of the hotel and all taxi driver know exactly the hotel location"
463,Date of stay: August 2013,50,A great surprise...,"Waited for more than 10 minutes at the check-in area because there was no visible queue at the check-in counter and the spot where I was waiting was slow moving. The check in staff whom I was waiting for while he was checking in for a group of guests didn't even bother saying things like ""Just a moment, Sir"". It was a bad start, until a lady staff named Andrea came out from a door behind the counter and said ""Sorry to keep you waiting, Sir"". At that moment, I was wondering whether she said that sentence because she knew I waited long, or was it just her standard phrase to the next guest whom she is about to attend to. But the way she said it gave me a feeling of the former.

Anyway, showing faces or complaining to staffs are not my usual attitude, so I just gave her a smile and said ""It's OK"". We had a great conversation during check-in, and she was in every way very professional. Not until we got to the door of the hotel room, she told us that she had upgraded us to a suite! O.M.G! A Peninsula Suite is never something we could afford, but we got upgraded for free. What else could we say? Thank you, Andrea... We were speechless when we saw the inside of the suite. It was pure Luxury...

Stunning view of the Harbour; High tech controls for lighting and AC; Spacious bathroom; Bathtub overlooking the Harbour; Free VOIP phone calls to anywhere in the world; Complimentary Internet Service with good speed; Huge walk-in closet; etc...

The only downside of this hotel is seeing guests lining up for the high tea at the Lobby. I understand about the tradition of High Tea at The Peninsula Hong Kong, but then I guess the part where guests are being stared down by those in the line is not much of a tradition, is it? Somehow we felt that the line was an eye-sore while at the Lobby...

Other than that, this hotel deserves the best compliment from us. Definitely the best City Hotel we've stayed so far. And we will be back!"
464,Date of stay: August 2013,50,"Second time, this time with kids.","This was my second stay at The Peninsula in HK.
I had a very nice time there last and wanted to share the experience with two of my sons.
We stayed at the hotel last weekend, my 12 and 10 year old sons joined me for this trip.

They loved being driven in the RR to the hotel, our room was not ready so we went up to
the pool and swam for an hour, had a great lunch and where whisked to our room at 2 pm.

The hotel rooms have been refurbished since I was here last and I really like what they have done to them.

Despite the price of the rooms, I liked the fact that all international calls placed on their VOIP
were free of charge. They do not have a great selection of TV Channels which is a minus but
they have a huge catalogue of films and these were free as well.

We were pretty jetlagged and enjoyed watching a couple of new movies.

Service was of course excellent on all levels, I would like to say a special thank you to the staff
at the Spa reception and pool who were exceptionally warm and helpful.

Breakfast was good, Afternoon Tea was OK but nothing exceptional, I was amazed that the receptionist recognized me upon checkout, she knew both my name and room number.

The staff at the reception were excellent, I read some reviews in regards to ""special guests"" etc and do not agree with them at all.

All the guests at the hotel, from all over the world were courteous, well behaved and noise levels
were low (with or without kids).

Two negatives; they should adopt Harrod's policy and not allow backpacks, nothing against them but I hate being bumped into by other peoples backpacks, these should be carried in hand.
Also, I was surprised that they do not 24H room service, we were jetlagged and my kids wanted
milk and sandwiches at 1 am.

All in all though a lovely stay, well worth the cost, will always stay here."
465,Date of stay: September 2012,50,BEAUTIFUL,The Staff were very helpful and extremely friendly.The hotel has a very cultural yet Comfortable ambience to it .....Excellent harbour view as well..We booked the Deluxe suite for space and further comfort.....Will definitely go back to this resort again.
466,Date of stay: July 2013,50,One of its kind,We were wowed from the time we stepped into the hotel until the day we left. A heritage hotel in hongkong. Top service. Rooms are well maintained and everyone tried to please us in all the ways possible. Thank you Peninsula Team.
467,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Best of the best,"Wow !! It really is the best of the best,very opulent in every way .The rooms have all been refurbished and even if a little small they are equipped with the latest amenities, from the flat screen, to block out and electronic blinds, to coffee makers , all the phone adapters ever, etc.. Make sure you do request a room with the arbor view (,it is the view over Hong Kong) .The service is impeccable ,the concierge? a magician (they will get anything done for you).High tea its a MUST,even if you don't book and there are people waiting, just ask and the staff will accommodate you.Must have breakfast on the first floor,the FOOD ? YUM!! But to all the cold people out there, it is extremely cold due to subzero air conditioners so do tell the staff but still bring a COAT!! An other must is Felix( the Michelin) restaurant, THE FOOD is AMAZING( and i am very fussy) and don't forget the laser show at 8 pm over the city ,so do request a table over looking the city.I do recommend the Rolls Roy pick up from the airport ,worth every penny. Highly recommend the helicopter ride over the city , the only way you get to understand Hong Kong.
."
468,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Grand,"100 Years & this hotel still stands for elegance & grandure
visited the Hotel for drinks @ Felix's Fabolous views of the city but couldnt understand why the designer had the floor to ceiling double floor windows clad with venetian blinds!!! stuck out like a sore thumb!"
469,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Highest Standards,"It's hard to live up to high expectations but the Peninsula was just awesome. My wife & I stayed 3 nights in mid-July 2013 with our 12-year old daughter. We splurged for the airport transfer by Rolls Royce and the hotel staff met us as we got off the plane at the gate - before customs & immigration - and he even picked up our bags from the carousel. The room was high tech to say the least. Touchscreen controllers for everything (lights, curtains, thermostat, TV, etc.) I was pleased that the room included plenty of outlets to charge our computers, iPhones, etc. without the need of any adapters for our North American style plugs and had at least one USB charger too. (it's mostly 220, but modern cameras & phones allow for the higher voltage if you can plug them in).

We used the pool to unwind for an hour and it's large - great for laps - and has a nice view. The jacuzzi wasn't heated.

We ate at the breakfast buffet at The Verandah three times and it excellent. Service, presentation, everything was top notch. We ate at the Spring Moon once and it was good food, but service seemed slow and dishes were pricey. Also had high tea in ""The Lobby"" which is billed as ""Afternoon Tea in total grandeur"" - exactly as advertised.

I know for my family, this hotel has become the hotel that all future hotel stays will be compared to."
470,Date of stay: April 2013,50,Wonderful experience,"A truly amazing experience. We arrived for our two day stay at the Peninsula only to be informed that the hotel had taken the liberty of upgrading our room to a Harbor View room in the new tower and what an upgrade. Truly the view in the room must be if not the best then close to one of the most stunning views of the harbor. Who needs the postcards when you can take a photo out the window and get a picture just as fine? Superb!

Our baggage newer made it to our flight from London. This was reported at the airport and also informed to the staff at Peninsula. The staff truly made a lot of effort to get our baggage out before we left two days later calling for information at the baggage reclaim numerous times a day. In the end our luggage arrived before our departure to Australia. Superb!

Truly, if ever you have the opportunity to live at this great hotel do it. You will be pleasantly surprised."
471,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Lovely Peninsula!,"Stayed here as a last night stop-over treat on the way home from Australia - and it couldn't have been nicer! We stayed in a recently refurbished deluxe room - no view, but no less splendid for that. The room was delightful - full of gadgets and gizmos including tablet controlled TV, blinds, lights etc. There is a TV in the bathroom and a very luxurious marble bathroom it is too! The bed was large with fabulous linens and the towels were big and fluffy. The staff were great - we were collected straight off the plane and ferried in a golf buggy through the very large and busy Hong Kong airport straight to our waiting car. On arrival we were shown to theroom and then a pot of welcome jasmine tea was served. In the morning papers are delivered through an internal post cupboard system so that they are not left outside your room! We ate in Felix restaurant which was OK, but a bit faddy (the menu is presented on iPads, but then the waiter writes down the order!) - but breakfast in the lobby was lovely. I'm only sad that we had just 1 night here, but next time I'm in Hong Kong this will be the place for me!"
472,Date of stay: April 2013,40,Grand High-Tea Chimes!,"There is something about grand ol hotels and their over the top elegance that only the super riche and moneyed elite can conjour up. Such is the effect of arriving at a place such as the Peninsula. While there are many grander super uber huge mega towers for the traveling elite, these older babes show us all how it all began.

When in HK do as the Brits do if you can!
I took my 6 yr old daughter and my father here for the P's classic afternoon high tea. Yes its a small fortune but still an affordable one and quite a fun ride.
The 3 tiered tray of delicious goodies, the dishes, cutlery, meticulous waiters, the rich gazing, the wannabee gazing, against the wonderfull historic backdrop of this elegant ol dame. I cant think of a better way to step out of HKs bustle. Suspend time, honor of the Queen for a few wonderful afternoon hours and then, when our ready, unclick that clock and head back out to get clobbered again by HKs never ceasing energy!"
473,Date of stay: July 2013,50,old favourite never fails,"I was in HK for business and had Sunday evening to spare so after long flight ex UK I went over to Kowloon (by Star Ferry!) and after walking around called in at the Peninsula for a light supper. Service and quality was as good as ever even just for a light supper in the lobby lounge. As I walked past earlier in the afternoon there was a tea dance in progress with ladies in beautiful dresses dancing to a good live band.

If you haven't been there go and try it, its an oasis of calm amongst a frenetic city"
474,Date of stay: August 2012,50,Best hotel ever,This was the best hotel experience that my husband and I ever enjoyed. Everything was perfect. It surpassed our expectations. The staff were excellent. The food was amazing. The location was central. The pool was so relaxing. The view from the pool terrace of the nightly light show was spectacular.
475,Date of stay: July 2013,50,Great experience from a hotel that knows what quality service is...,"I came to Hong Kong over 20 years ago and this morning I dropped back into the Peninsula for old times sake. From the first greeting at the door, to the wonderful service as we sipped coffee and reminisced, the Peninsula continued to impress. Nothing has changed; the service is outstanding, the ambience beautiful and restful and the experience is one of a classy establishment that continues to know how to impress. I have carried my memories of afternoon tea at the Peninsula around for all these years and they will carry on with me, renewed and with a happy smile on my face. Thanks to all the attentive staff for making me feel so welcome and valued."
476,Date of stay: May 2013,50,Wonderful stay in HK!,"THE place to stay when in Hong Kong. Enjoyed a Grand Deluxe Harbour View Room which has fantastic views of the HK skyline. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Fantastic ambiance. For a nice drink head to the Felix bar on the top floor. The Pen is a great starting point as well to enjoy the city. Ferries, underground and limos are all near by."
477,Date of stay: January 2013,50,World Class,"It is the Peninsula, what more can be said. The hotel had someone waiting for us at the gate coming off the plane. Electric cart brought us straight to customs. A Merc was waiting after customs. Really grand and well maintained hotel. I would recommend the old building over the new as I think it has more charm and character."
478,Date of stay: June 2013,50,Expensive but you get what you pay for,"The public areas, rooms and service could not be better. Treat yourself to at least one night when in Hong Kong, and spring for a room with a view of Victoria Harbor. Expensive but you get what you pay for."
479,Date of stay: June 2013,30,"Everyone says its is good, I think maybe but.......","I was looking forward to staying at the Peninsular as everyone seems to rave about how fantastic it is. I was warned about the hotel now being patronised by the new rich, but thought ""How bad can it be?""

Transfers and Check-in:
Met at the airbridge and taken by shuttle to immigration and helped with our luggage. Nothing special as other Hotels like Mandarin Oriental offer this service. The 2 of us were driven in a 7 seater van to the hotel as we had golf bags, otherwise it would have been the Rolls or the Merc. Met at the front door and escorted to our room where we were checked in. That was good as we did not have to wait in a queue.

The Room:
Nice spacious room with separate shower stalls and bathtub with a TV to boot. There were a His & Hers sinks with appropriate amenities. What i thought unusual was that the cleaning lady did not top up (replace) the shaving or the dental kit after I used them the first day. I have not come across this in any of the hotels that I have stayed in.
Complimentary coffee making facilities and water. There was a bowl of fruit that was replaced daily. Well thought out room with plenty of power points suitable for various international plugs. There was even a charging station with a whole range of power adapters to suite various makes of mobile phones and tablets. Minibar was adequate.

The Freebies:
Free wireless internet with good signal and usability. Multiple login is permitted and is also available throughout the hotel.
Free local calls
Free VOIP international Calls - quality was pretty good.
Free use of an in-room printer
Free Movies channel on the TV with the latest release on demand.
No iron or Ironing board - you are not expected to wash in your rooms.

Breakfast
This was included in our package. The first day we had breakfast in the lobby. The table service was good and we had the traditional ham(or sausage, not both) and eggs, juice or pancake breakfast. Choice was limited.
The next day we had breakfast in the first floor. There was a reasonable range of food from Chinese, Japanese to pastries and fruit. It was pretty good, not the best.

Swimming Pool
The indoor swimming pool is luxurious and well appointed with good views over the harbour.

Afternoon High Tea
We booked a table in advance and was seated at the appointed time. There was a long queue of people waiting to be seated for afternoon tea. It is a tradition passed down from the old colonial days, and the hotel is well know for this. Our 3 tiered tray of food was adequate to serve 5 people. This was a pleasant experience.

Service:
The chauffeur who picked us up from the airport was excellent.. Most of the staff were also very good and pleasant. However I did not feel that I was special, something I expect from an excellent hotel. I suspect that as the majority of the clientele of the Peninsular has changed the staff have adapted to the guests. Although it has tried to maintain its traditional Colonial past, it has to cater for the new rich whose expectations and demands are different. They do no expect to have to queue for their turn.

So what was wrong?
Check out was a disaster. (Nobody told me I could have asked for an in room check-out. Really?)
Although I waited patiently for 5 minutes to be served, a queue jumper (the hotel's new rich clientele) barged in and was immediately served, ahead of me by the female receptionist! Four staff at the desk, 2 serving and 2 busy with the computer, none made eye contact to acknowledge my presence in all the time I stood there waiting to be served. Not what i expect of a 5 star hotel. After I complained bitterly about the way I was not being served, and had to demand to see the Duty Manager, before Andrea Michelle Platts, the Assistant Front Desk Manager appeared. She said ""Sorry"". She thanked me for bringing this matter to her attention. She did not care to identify the offending staff, but I guess it would not have been appropriate at the time. Somehow I felt that this was a gloss over. The hotel had not adequately trained their staff to handle these generation of ill mannered clienteles.
Andrea, how hard is it to train your staff to make all your guests (rich & poor) feel special? Even if they are busy typing on a computer, a simple look up, a smile and ""I will be with you soon"" is all it takes.
No, I did not feel special!
Lesser known hotels have made me feel special and that's what keeps me going back, not the freebies or the Rolls or the helicopter ride!
Thank you TripAdvisor for allowing me to tell Andrea and the rest of the world my experience at the Peninsular."
480,Date of stay: June 2013,50,Stellar Hotel,"Stellar hotel and service.
Expensive but you get what you pay.
Hotel staff from drivers, reception, housekeeping, restaurant and concierge were polite, courteous and helpful,
Great location. Close to transport and shops.
Indulge in breakfast or afternoon tea in lobby. Great ambience.
Put it on the bucket list."
481,Date of stay: June 2013,50,My new hotel of choice in Hong Kong.,"A very enjoyable stay. The hotel, fresh from its $450 million HKD refurbishment, is well appointed throughout, and although a few things could be improved is a great option should you be looking for a touch of old world, well appointed modern rooms, and good service. More details should you wish...

Arrival
I'd highly recommend the hotel Rolls Royce airport transfers ($1600 one way, or $2900 return). Escorted from the gate in a buggy, you are soon through immigration and customs. Upon arrival at the hotel, check-in is in-room - and was efficient and informative.

The Suite
The Grand Deluxe Harbour View Suite was very spacious (130 sq metres) and exceptionally well appointed, with views on three sides of the tower. See photos. No small touch has been overlooked - universal device chargers, noise cancelling head phones, iPhone connectors, Nespresso machine, free VoIP calls and in-room movies, and printer to name a few. Decor is contemporary, and the integrated tablet control system allows you to control most electronic devices in the room from one device.

The Bars
'Salon Ning' bar & club definitely was the highlight of the venues - with good service and a great 1930's Shanghai theme. 'The Bar' had disappointingly unattentive service, with a large albeit predictably main stream whisky selection and classic decor. 'Felix' on the top level of the tower has a great view, however service and drink selection again was disappointing.

The Food
Breakfast in the Lobby was a la carte, and although good it wasn't great. Room service was well presented and tasty.

The Spa
Recommended - a good selection of treatments, very relaxing and well appointed."
482,Date of stay: February 2013,50,It truly was the best,From the moment I arrived in hong kong I had per arranged to be picked up at the airport by the hotel was as I hoped there was my driver dressed perfect waiting by the green rolls Royce he was charming and very present and when I arrived at the hotel thay were ready for me up graded to a suite very nice like I expected a person on every floor 24 hours a day to make sure you have every thing you need and that your stay is the best you can have the food beyond good and afternoon tea in lobby wonderful your going to have the time of you life at this hotel it truly is a grand hotel and yes it cost but you know that already oh I must mention I took the helicopter back to airport from hotel roof heliport I couldn't resist that was the high light of my trip and that was affordable ?
483,Date of stay: June 2013,30,Bad service / unfriendly staff and far away for their promise,"""The Peninsula Hotels strive to provide high quality service""
This is what one would expect from this address.
Unfortunately we experienced a lobby café --- freezing cold and were served by the most unfriendly staff!
5 o'clock tea: After the order of tea the finger food arrived shortly after, but for the tea we've had to wait more than 20 minutes. Not even finished we were asked if we're ready for the check.
Soon after, while I was still eating, one of the waiters took away my plate. Obvoiusly
they wanted us out!
Although we had extended check out till 6pm, the cleaning lady pushed us every 5 minutes to get out of the room as she wanted to clean it up! IT WAS NOT 6pm yet!
The Peninsula I knew from previous years became a simple tourist hotel!
For sure I can't recommend it to any of my friends and partners!"
484,Date of stay: November 2012,50,Amazing,"stayed her in November 2012 - abolsulely amazing hotel. Brilliant location from the some of the main shops and even there markets.

they have recenetly refurbished there rooms and - WOW they look brilliant. Loved my stay there and the staff where always so helpful."
485,Date of stay: June 2013,50,"Great view,service and food",Location of this hotel is superb.right next to the avenue of stars and bay.beautiful view of hongkong.. next to museum of art. Great service. High tea in the lobby for view and relaxation. Can take the ferry over to hongkong very cheap.
486,Date of stay: June 2013,40,Oops! There's a dress code,"Wandered in on a hot day to sample the gargantuan, old world charm and imbibe a little blatant colonialism.
Very pleasant greeting before we sat down for cocktails or the famous afternoon tea - to be told politely that the dress code forbade open-toed shows. My be-sandalled feet walked disappointingly back to the beautiful entrance. No complaints: it was my fault for being a scruff!"
487,Date of stay: July 2012,50,"Waited a few years to go, worth it!","I've been to HK half a dozen times before but only last year decided that I would splurge for the experience of staying here. I used to walk past it and tell myself I'll stay here the next time I visit. It was well worth the wait. Everything was superlative, from the rooms to the service to the high tea to the location.
We also opted to be picked up at the airport by their Rolls Royce! Included was the special guide who waited for us as soon as we got off the plane, not after claiming our luggage but right at the door of the airport when we landed. They scooted us off on a cart and whizzed past everyone else through the insider's shortcut to the luggage pickup and customs area. We got there ahead of the other passengers and we were out of HKG airport less than 20 minutes after landing. Now that was definitely an experience.
Now that we're planning another trip early next year, I want to repeat this experience!"
488,Date of stay: January 2013,50,Where you go when you win XLotto,"I love this hotel - I could move in permanently. Fabulous rooms, views, beds, amenities. The staff are wonderful, the hotel is gorgeous, dining is great. The epitome of what a luxury experience should be."
489,Date of stay: June 2013,50,Simply Fantastic,"What can I say only WOW. This hotel is just fantastic in every way.
Staff very helpful. They remember the slightest details of your preferences. This hotel is on a complete different level from the others I stayed in while in Hong Kong.
The room is so modern and comfortable with every convenience you can think of at hand.
There are samsung tablets on the bedside lockers so you can control the temperature, lights and curtains for the bed.
The light switches are touchscreen and a tv in the bathroom so you can be entertained while soaking in the bath.
VOIP option available on the phones (basically using the internet to make calls) so no charge to the user. Clever use of free technology that puts this hotel Way ahead of its competitors.
I used the swimming pool which was great with fantastic views of the harbour from the garden on front. So relaxing.
Enjoyed breakfast in both the lobby and the verandah restaurant. Both excellent.
Had the afternoon tea experience also. Expensive but worth it for the experience alone.
Huge queue of people waiting for a table that were not guests shows how popular it is.
Loved this hotel and hope to stay here again."
490,Date of stay: May 2013,50,Sunday Tea Dances,"We didn't stay at the hotel, but went for high tea on the Sunday afternoon. It was great fun & the height of indulgence. There was dancing to a sextet and Cabernet singer. It is obviously a firm social fixture for locals.

Champagne, savouries & cakes. True opulence. An expensive indulgence, but worth splashing out for."
491,Date of stay: April 2013,50,Luxury with a capital L,"We spent an evening at the lovely Peninsula hotel having happy hour at the main bar, dinner at Chesa, and more drinks at the upstairs bar. There are several restaurants to choose from. We found prices to be very fair for this hotel. We thoroughly enjoyed this lovely date-night on our trip to Hong Kong. While the hotel is exquisite, there is also a good bit of history too it. The Peninsula was once the end of the Trans Siberian Railroad. Many icons & celebrities have dined here, including 1 of my faves Rhett Butler. The hotel also has a fleet of Rolls Royce's for the hotel guests. A stop at this hotel was recommended in my Frommer's Guide, and was a great one."
492,Date of stay: February 2013,50,Emotional Rescue,"Well here's to feeling good all the time !! - Because that's what happens when you check into arguably the best luxury hotel in the world. - The Peninsula Hong Kong.

The wife and I travel overseas several times each year and we always book luxury hotels. - The Peninsula is a consistent stand out. Things just work here when it comes to staff interaction and you receive a genuine emotional reward when you stay.

Checked into a deluxe harbor view suite in the newly renovated towers and it was devine. - Beautifully appointed and luxurious it was one of the lovliest suites we have stayed in.

It's not just the property that is perfect, it's the wonderful nature of the staff, most of whom you find out when you chat with them, have been working there for years or even decades. - a true indication of a successful business, low staff turnover due to excellent management culture from the top down.

From the moment you land and are whisked away from the airport in a beautiful British racing Green Rolls Royce you know you are in safe hands. This trip we tried the helicopter transfer from the ""China Clipper"" lounge on top of the hotel to the airport when we departed and this is definately worth the expense if you want to dial up the wow factor.

Numerous Staff in the hotel recognized us from previous stays and greeted us by name on arrival as well as during our stay and this made us feel all the more welcome. - Room service staff soon learned what we liked for breakfast and when we rang in the morning they would ask if we wanted ""the usual"" or something else.

Nothing in this hotel is too much trouble. I mentioned to staff that my wife had closed the zipper on her case and jammed one of her tops in it. Five minutes later a staff member arrived and took the case away. The article of clothing was removed and sent to their master tailor who repaired it so well you could not pick it was damaged by the zipper (they had to damage it to remove it, which we agreed to) it was then returned after the hotel cleaned it. The case was returned polished and cleaned as well. A manager arrived with them both to ensure we were happy with what had transpired. - No charge for any of that, just part of the five star exceptional Peninsula service.

Restaurants, bars, the spa and all other amenities in this hotel are exceptional as is the hotels convenient location to shops and other Hong Kong attractions.

The concierge arranged for a half day tour for us with our own Rolls Royce and driver. We spent the day visiting Stanley, Repulse bay and other attractions, stopping for lunch at the Repulse bay hotel which was recommended. - It was a fantastic day trip and the driver, who had been with the hotel for 14 years, was very knowledgable and friendly.

We have stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong six times now in recent years and it's always a pleasure to return. - Do yourself a big favour, give it a try."
493,Date of stay: January 2013,50,Beautiful heritage hotel. World class.,"The Peninsular Hotel is a very special hotel.

Firstly the location. Right at the top of Nathan Road in Kowloon, overlooking the harbour. Great for shopping and watching the night lights.

Secondly, the heritage and history that the building just seeps with. It really is the grand old dame. From the doormen to the reception staff, the lovely foyer and the “old” rooms with the drop box for your newspaper or leaving your shoes in to be polished. This hotel is steeped in history, and the service is simply second to none.

In my last visit, I stayed in the Towers, which have just been refurbished. The rooms are superb and now very modern with huge flat screens, your own latte machine etc . Everything in your room is controlled by an ipad style pad, which controls the curtains, TV, lights, phone, room service, do not disturb, alarm etc. While they are trying to blend the heritage of the Chinese and British, I do wonder if the bedroom refurbishment to modernise it has lost some of that character. It could have been any top world class 5 star, recently refurnished room. There was nothing specific in the room that you would have known it was the historical Peninsular Hong Kong.

Two good new additions to the rooms. They use VOIP so you have free telephone calls around the world. The other one is that in one of the drawers, it has charger plug connections for most cellphones, so you can plug in and charge up very easily.

I also used the gym on this last trip. A good selection of equipment, and as normal, always an attentive person nearby to give you a fresh towel or a bottle of water.

A very fine hotel, one of the best in the world."
